<div class="abstract">We experimentally investigate the effect of electron temperature on transport in the two-dimensional Dirac surface states of the three-dimensional topological insulator HgTe. We find that around the minimal conductivity point, where both electrons and holes are present, heating the carriers with a DC current results in a non-monotonic differential resistance of narrow channels. We show that the observed initial increase in resistance can be attributed to electron-hole scattering, while the decrease follows naturally from the change in Fermi energy of the charge carriers. Both effects are governed dominantly by a van Hove singularity in the bulk valence band. The results demonstrate the importance of interband electron-hole scattering in the transport properties of topological insulators.</div>

<div class="abstract">Chiral interaction between light and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) has recently drawn enormous scientific attention. The optical selection rules of these atomically thin semiconductors allow the attribution of a pseudospin to the TMDs' valleys, which can be coherently manipulated for information processing using polarized light. The interaction of TMDs with circularly and linearly polarized light creates the valley polarization and coherence, respectively. With a full Stokes polarization analysis of light emitted from WS2 monolayer flakes, we conclusively confirm the existence of coherence between its valleys. We observe spatial heterogeneity in photoluminescence intensity, valley polarization and valley coherence. The discovery of an inverse proportional relationship between photoluminescence intensity and both valley polarization and coherence, reveals a correlation between the (non-)radiative decay rate and the valley hopping. The temperature dependence confirms the phononic nature of valley depolarization and decoherence, that may be caused by strain and the presence of defects.</div>

<div class="abstract">Deterministic photon-photon gates enable the controlled generation of entanglement between mobile carriers of quantum information. Such gates have thus far been exclusively realized in the optical domain and by relying on post-selection. Here, we present a non-post-selected, deterministic, photon-photon gate in the microwave frequency range realized using superconducting circuits. We emit photonic qubits from a source chip and route those qubits to a gate chip with which we realize a universal gate set by combining controlled absorption and re-emission with single-qubit gates and qubit-photon controlled-phase gates. We measure quantum process fidelities of $75\,\%$ for single- and of $57\,\%$ for two-qubit gates, limited mainly by radiation loss and decoherence. This universal gate set has a wide range of potential applications in superconducting quantum networks.</div>

<div class="abstract">Nuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing, because of their exceptional quantum coherence and atomic-scale footprint. However, the full potential of nuclear spins for quantum computing has not yet been realized, due to the lack of high-fidelity multi-qubit operations, and of pathways to distribute quantum information among nuclei within a scalable device. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted $^{31}$P nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin, and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)%. The quantum operations are precisely characterised using gate set tomography (GST), yielding one-qubit gate fidelities up to 99.93(3)% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.21(14)%. The GST analysis provides unprecedented details on the nature of the errors -- including the emergence of correlated and entangling errors -- which will be crucial for developing fault-tolerant quantum processors. We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)% fidelity. Since electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons or physically shuttled across different locations, these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using nuclear spins.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Second-order topological semimetals (SOTSMs) is featured with the presence of hinge Fermi arc. How to generate SOTSMs in different systems has attracted much attention. We here propose a scheme to create exotic SOTSMs by periodic driving. It is found that novel Dirac SOTSMs with a widely tunable number of nodes and hinge Fermi arcs, the adjacent nodes with same chirality, and the coexisting nodal points and nodal loops can be generated at ease by the periodic driving. When the time-reversal symmetry is broken, our scheme also permits us to realize an exotic hybrid-order Weyl semimetals with the coexisting hinge and surface Fermi arcs. The multiplicity of the zero- and $\pi/T$-mode Weyl points endows our system more colorful 2D sliced topological phases, which can be any combination of normal insulator, Chern insulator, and SOTI, than the static case. Enriching the family of topological semimetals, our scheme supplies a convenient way to artificially synthesize and control exotic topological phases by periodic driving.</div>

<div class="abstract">In Weyl semimetals the location of linear band crossings, the Weyl cones, is not bound to any high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone, unlike the Dirac nodes in graphene. This flexibility is advantageous for valleytronics, where information is encoded in the valleys of the band structure when intervalley scattering is weak. However, if numerous Weyl cones coexist the encoded information can decohere rapidly because of band mixing. Here, we investigate how the helical iso-spin texture of Weyl cones affects valleytronics in heterojunctions of Weyl materials, and show how the chirality of this iso-spin texture can serve to encode information.</div>

<div class="abstract">We study the effects caused by Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling over the thermoelectric transport properties of a single-electron transistor, viz., a quantum dot connected to one-dimensional leads. Using linear response theory and employing the numerical renormalization group method, we calculate the thermopower, electrical and thermal conductances, dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, and study the Wiedemann-Franz law, showing their temperature maps. Our results for all those properties indicate that spin-orbit coupling drives the system into the Kondo regime. We show that the thermoelectric transport properties, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, obey the expected universality of the Kondo strong coupling fixed point. In addition, our results show a notable increase in the thermoelectric figure of merit, caused by the spin-orbit coupling in the one-dimensional quantum dot leads.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Interferometry provides direct evidence for anyon statistics. In the fractional quantum Hall effect, interferometers are susceptible to dephasing by neutral modes. The latter support chargeless quasiparticles (neutralons) which propagate upstream along the edge and obey fractional statistics. Here we show that on a suitably engineered bilayer fractional quantum Hall edge, which is an experimentally available platform, the neutral modes can be gapped while leaving the desired charge modes gapless. The gapping mechanism is akin to a ``four-particle pairing'' superconductivity. Our considered bilayer structure can be shaped as an anyonic interferometer. We also discuss experimental charge transport signatures of the neutral mode gap.</div>

<div class="abstract">Quantum dots are recognized as a suitable platform for studying thermodynamic phenomena involving single electronic charges and spins in nano-scale devices. However, such a thermodynamic system is usually driven by electron reservoirs at different temperatures, not by a lattice temperature gradient. We report on experimental observations of charge-spin cooperative dynamics in transitions of two-electron spin states in a GaAs double quantum dot located in a non-equilibrium phonon environment. Enhancements in the spin-flip processes are observed, originating from phonon excitation combined with the spin-orbit interaction. In addition, due to the spatial gradient of phonon density between the dots, the spin-flip rate during an inter-dot electron tunnel from a hot to a cold dot is more enhanced than in the other direction, resulting in accumulation of parallel spin states in the double dot.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) provides an example of a system in which the interplay of interlayer interactions and superlattice structure impacts electron transport in a variety of non-trivial ways and gives rise to a plethora of interesting effects. Understanding the mechanisms of electron scattering in TBG has, however, proven challenging, raising many questions about the origins of resistivity in this system. Here we show that TBG exhibits high-temperature magnetooscillations originating from the scattering of charge carriers between TBG minivalleys. The amplitude of these oscillations reveals that interminivalley scattering is strong, and its characteristic time scale is comparable to that of its intraminivalley counterpart. Furthermore, by exploring the temperature dependence of these oscillations, we estimate the electron-electron collision rate in TBG and find that it exceeds that of monolayer graphene. Our study demonstrates the consequences of the relatively small size of the superlattice Brillouin zone and Fermi velocity reduction on lateral transport in TBG.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>D. Buterakos, S. D. Sarma</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The presence of valley states is a significant obstacle to realizing quantum information technologies in Silicon quantum dots, as leakage into alternate valley states can introduce errors into the computation. We use a perturbative analytical approach to study the dynamics of exchange-coupled quantum dots with valley degrees of freedom. We show that if the valley splitting is large and electrons are not properly initialized to valley eigenstates, then time evolution of the system will lead to spin-valley entanglement. Spin-valley entanglement will also occur if the valley splitting is small and electrons are not initialized to the same valley state. Additionally, we show that for small valley splitting, spin-valley entanglement does not affect measurement probabilities of two-qubit systems; however, systems with more qubits will be affected. This means that two-qubit gate fidelities measured in two-qubit systems may miss the effects of valley degrees of freedom. Our work shows how the existence of valleys may adversely affect multiqubit fidelities even when the system temperature is very low.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Using the continuum model, we investigate the electronic properties of two types of bilayer graphene ring (BLGR) geometries: (i) an isolated BLGR and (ii) a monolayer graphene (MLG) ring put on top of an infinite graphene sheet. Solving the Dirac-Weyl equation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and applying infinite-mass boundary condition at the ring boundaries, we obtain analytical results for the energy levels and corresponding wave spinors for both structures. Our results show that the presence of interface boundary in a hybrid BLGR modifies drastically the energy levels as compared to that of an isolated BLGR. The intervalley symmetry $ E^K_e (m) = -E^{K'}_h(m) $ between the electron (e) and hole (h) states ($ m $ being the angular momentum quantum number) is found for the energy spectrum of an isolated BLGR, while it is broken for the hybrid BLGR. Our analytical results agree with those obtained within the tight-binding model (TBM). Sizeable and magnetically tunable band gap, in contrast to that in the zero-width BLGR model, is predicted for both ring structures, which experimentally can be measured in, e.g., magnetotransport measurements.</div>

<div class="abstract">Little-Parks oscillations of a hollow superconducting cylinder are of interest for flux-driven topological superconductivity in single Rashba nanowires. The oscillations are typically symmetric in the orientation of the applied magnetic flux. Using double InAs nanowires coated by an epitaxial superconducting Al shell which, despite the non-centro-symmetric geometry, behaves effectively as one hollow cylinder, we demonstrate that a small misalignment of the applied parallel field with respect to the axis of the nanowires can produce field-asymmetric Little-Parks oscillations. These are revealed by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the misaligned parallel field direction. The asymmetry occurs in both the destructive regime, in which superconductivity is destroyed for half-integer quanta of flux through the shell, and in the non-destructive regime, where superconductivity is depressed but not fully destroyed at these flux values.</div>

<div class="abstract">Magnetic impurities in $s$-wave superconductors lead to spin-polarized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) in-gap states. Chains of magnetic impurities offer one of the most viable routes for the realization of Majorana bound states which hold a promise for topological quantum computing. However, this ambitious goal looks distant since no quantum coherent degrees of freedom have yet been identified in these systems. To fill this gap we propose an effective two-level system, a YSR qubit, stemming from two nearby impurities. Using a time-dependent wave-function approach, we derive an effective Hamiltonian describing the YSR qubit evolution as a function of distance between the impurity spins, their relative orientations, and their dynamics. We show that the YSR qubit can be controlled and read out using the state-of-the-art experimental techniques for manipulation of the spins. Finally, we address the effect of the spin noises on the coherence properties of the YSR qubit, and show a robust behaviour for a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters. Looking forward, the YSR qubit could facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates in hybrid systems where they are coupled to topological Majorana qubits.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>B. Mera, N. Goldman</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum geometry has emerged as a central and ubiquitous concept in quantum sciences, with direct consequences on quantum metrology and many-body quantum physics. In this context, two fundamental geometric quantities play complementary roles: the Fubini-Study metric, which introduces a notion of distance between quantum states defined over a parameter space, and the Berry curvature associated with Berry-phase effects and topological band structures. In fact, recent studies have revealed direct relations between these two important quantities, suggesting that topological properties can, in special cases, be deduced from the quantum metric. In this work, we establish general and exact relations between the quantum metric and the topological invariants of generic Dirac Hamiltonians. In particular, we demonstrate that topological indices (Chern numbers or winding numbers) are bounded by the quantum volume determined by the quantum metric. Our theoretical framework, which builds on the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, is applicable to topological insulators and semimetals of arbitrary spatial dimensions, with or without chiral symmetry. This work clarifies the role of the Fubini-Study metric in topological states of matter, suggesting unexplored topological responses and metrological applications in a broad class of quantum-engineered systems.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Majorana zero modes are predicted in several solid state systems such as hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures and topological insulators coupled to superconductors. One of the expected signatures of Majorana modes is the fractional 4$\pi$ Josephson effect. Evidence in favor of this effect often comes from a.c. Josephson effect measurements and focuses on the observation of missing first or higher odd-numbered Shapiro steps. However, the disappearance of the odd Shapiro steps has also been reported in conventional Josephson junctions where no Majorana modes are expected. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model that displays suppression of the odd Shapiro steps. We perform resistively-shunted junction model calculations and introduce peaks in differential resistance as function of the bias current. In the presence of only the standard 2$\pi$ Josephson current, for chosen values of peak positions and amplitudes, we can suppress the odd Shapiro steps, or any steps, thus providing a possible explanation for the observation of missing Shapiro steps.</div>
