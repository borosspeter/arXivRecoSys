<div class="abstract">Hole spins in semiconductor quantum dots represent a viable route for the implementation of electrically controlled qubits. In particular, the qubit implementation based on Si pMOSFETs offers great potentialities in terms of integration with the control electronics and long-term scalability. Moreover, the future down scaling of these devices will possibly improve the performance of both the classical (control) and quantum components of such monolithically integrated circuits. Here we use a multi-scale approach to simulate a hole-spin qubit in a down scaled Si-channel pMOSFET, whose structure is based on a commercial 22nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator device. Our calculations show the formation of well defined hole quantum dots within the Si channel, and the possibility of a general electrical control, with Rabi frequencies of the order of 100 MHz for realistic field values. Our calculations demonstrate the crucial role of the channel aspect ratio, and the presence of a favorable parameter range for the qubit manipulation.</div>

<div class="abstract">Clock transitions (CTs) have been shown to protect qubits against various sources of decoherence. Here, we present a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the decoupling of a central electron spin qubit from the surrounding nuclear spin bath by studying the so-called Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) effect in the vicinity of a magnetic CT. Experimentally, ESEEM spectra are collected for a HoW$_{10}$ molecular spin qubit, and suppression of the modulation at a CT is clearly demonstrated. The effect is then simulated theoretically by exact quantum time evolution using a simple model Hamiltonian of a central electron spin with an avoided Zeeman crossing coupled to a finite number of nuclear bath spins. The results reproduce key experimental observations and reveal that, due to the quadratic energy dependence on magnetic field at the avoided crossing, fluctuations of the nuclear spin bath that couple linearly to the central spin do not affect its quantum dynamics at the CT. Consequently, hyperfine coupling effectively vanishes, leading to a complete suppression of ESEEM and electron-nuclear decoherence at the CT.</div>

<div class="abstract">The interplay between non-trivial topological states of matter and strong electronic correlations is one of the most compelling open questions in condensed matter physics. Due to experimental challenges, there is an increasing desire to find more microscopic techniques to complement the results of more traditional experiments. In this work, we locally explore the Kondo insulator Sm$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$B$_{6}$ by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) of Gd$^{3+}$ ions at low temperatures. Our analysis reveals that the Gd$^{3+}$ ESR line shape shows an anomalous evolution as a function of temperature, wherein for highly dilute samples (x $\approx$ 0.0002) the Gd$^{3+}$ ESR line shape changes from a localized ESR local moment character to a diffusive-like character. Upon manipulating the sample surface with a focused ion beam we demonstrate, in combination with electrical resistivity measurements, that the localized character of the Gd$^{3+}$ ESR line shape is recovered by increasing the penetration of the microwave in the sample. This provides compelling evidence for the contribution of surface or near-surface excitations to the relaxation mechanism in the Gd$^{3+}$ spin dynamics. Our work brings new insights into the importance of non-trivial surface excitations in ESR, opening new routes to be explored both theoretically and experimentally.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Line waves are recently discovered wave entities that are localized along two directions, and therefore can be viewed as the one-dimensional counterpart of surface waves. These waves can be supported at discontinuities of the surface reactance and/or resistance of low-dimensional materials such as metasurfaces or graphene. Here, a broader class of non-Hermitian surface-impedance junctions is studied that can support coupled line waves, and allows investigating different one-dimensional waveguiding mechanisms in a unified framework. It is theoretically demonstrated that, under parity-time-symmetry conditions, exceptional points can occur in a truly flat-optics scenario, hence endowing these novel waveguiding systems with the attractive features of both line-wave and exceptional-point physics, and shedding new light on the phase transitions existing in these systems. It is also shown that the required surface-impedance parameters are compatible with those attainable with typical models of photoexcited graphene metasurfaces at terahertz frequencies. In addition to providing new understanding in the physics of line waves, which is still in its infancy, these results pave the way to novel intriguing developments in the largely unexplored field of non-Hermitian flat optics, with possible applications ranging from sensing to lasing and on-chip optical signal processing.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Pauli blockade mechanisms -- whereby carrier transport through quantum dots (QDs) is blocked due to selection rules even when energetically allowed -- are of both fundamental and technological interest, as a direct manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle and as a key mechanism for manipulating and reading out spin qubits. Pauli spin blockade is well established for systems such as GaAs QDs, where the two-electron spin-singlet ground state is separated from the three triplet states higher in energy. However, Pauli blockade physics remains largely unexplored for systems in which the Hilbert space is expanded due to additional degrees of freedom, such as the valley quantum numbers in carbon-based materials or silicon. Here we report experiments on coupled graphene double QDs in which the spin and valley states can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate that gate and magnetic-field tuning allows switching between a spin-triplet--valley-singlet ground state with charge occupancy (2,0), where valley-blockade is observed, and a spin-singlet--valley-triplet ground state, where spin blockade is shown. These results demonstrate how the complex two-particle Hilbert space of graphene quantum dots can be unravelled experimentally, with implications for future spin and valley qubits.</div>

<div class="abstract">We demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength for electrons near the conduction band edge in few-layer $\gamma$-InSe films can be tuned over a wide range. This tunability is the result of a competition between film-thickness-dependent intrinsic and electric-field-induced SOC, potentially, allowing for electrically switchable spintronic devices. Using a hybrid $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ tight-binding model, fully parameterized with the help of density functional theory computations, we quantify SOC strength for various geometries of InSe-based field-effect transistors. The theoretically computed SOC strengths are compared with the results of weak antilocalization measurements on dual-gated multilayer InSe films, interpreted in terms of Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation due to SOC, showing a good agreement between theory and experiment.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Nodal-line semimetals with magnetic orders have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in only few compounds. We theoretically explore the electronic structure in bulk and boundary of such a magnetic nodal-line state by introducing magnetism in topological Dirac semimetal (TDSM). TDSMs, such as $\mathrm{Cd_3 As_2}$ and $\mathrm{Na_3 Bi}$, are characterized by a pair of spin-degenerate Dirac points protected by rotational symmetries of crystals. By introducing local magnetic moments coupled to the electron spins in the lattice model of TDSM, we show that the TDSM can turn into either a Weyl semimetal or a nodal-line semimetal, which is determined by the orbital dependence in the exchange coupling and the direction of magnetization formed by the magnetic moments. In this magnetic nodal-line semimetal state, we find zero modes with drumhead-like band structure at the boundary that are characterized by the topological number of $\mathbb{Z}$. Those zero modes are numerically demonstrated by introducing magnetic domain walls in the lattice model.</div>

<div class="abstract">A hybrid setup consisting of a superconductivity-proximitized quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator and a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is proposed for chiral injection of electrons into the Majorana bound state (MBS). An unexplored region of the phase space involving the exchange field induced boost of the helical edge state is then proposed for the detection of the MBS. 2-D transport simulations of our proposed setup is compared with the corresponding setup in the absence of the QAH region, when moderate disorder and a small but finite bulk out-of-plane magnetic field and a Rashba field are included. The remarkable contrast between the two results demonstrates the possibility for an unprecedented immunity from disorder-induced masking of the MBS detection in our proposed setup.</div>

<div class="abstract">The field of electron spin resonance is in constant need to improve its capabilities. Among other things, this means having better resonators which would provide improved spin sensitivity, as well as enable larger microwave magnetic field power conversion factors. Surface micro resonators, made of small metallic patches on a dielectric substrate, provide very good absolute spin sensitivity and high conversion factors due to their very small mode volume. However, such resonators suffer from having a relatively low quality factor, which offsets some of their significant potential advantages. The use of superconducting patches to replace the metallic layer seems like a reasonable and straightforward solution to the quality factor issue, at least for measurements carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, superconducting materials are not easily incorporated into setups requiring high magnetic fields, due to electric current vortices generated in the latter's surface. This makes the transition from normal conducing materials to superconductors highly nontrivial. Here we present the design, fabrication, and testing results of surface micro resonators made of yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) superconducting material. We show that with a unique experimental setup, these resonators can be made to operate well even at high fields of about 1.2 T. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of current vortices on the ESR signal and the spins' coherence times. Finally, we provide a head to head comparison of YBCO vs copper resonators of the same dimensions, which clearly shows their pros and cons and directs us to future potential developments and improvements in this field.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>N. K. Dongre, K. Roychowdhury</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Weyl semimetals exhibit exotic transport responses, among which, recently Goos-Haenchen (GH) and Imbert-Fedorov (IF) effects have received a revived attention, which are, otherwise, well-studied phenomena in optical systems and certain electronic systems. Besides the usual parametric dependence of the shifts inherited from the underlying Hamiltonian to describe the Weyl system and/or that induced by external controls, the IF shift further carries a topological identity -- it depends on the chirality of the Weyl cones. A realistic system of Weyl semimetal naturally accommodates surface potentials induced by impurities present on its surface that could pose impediments to observe clean transport signatures predicted in theoretical models. Classifying these potentials, we study their effects on GH and IF shifts to provide useful guidance to future experiments that are tuned to the objective of characterizing Weyl semimetals and for a possible realisation of novel devices based on these phenomena. A transfer matrix-based approach is invoked to study the profile of Weyl wavefunctions across the interface which is hosting the impurity potentials, revealing that such potentials can lead to several discerning effects which, in certain cases, extend even to nullifying the IF shift completely and giving rise to phenomenon like valley inversion.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Selection rules are often considered a hallmark of symmetry. When a symmetry is broken, e.g., by an external perturbation, the system exhibits selection rule deviations which are often analyzed by perturbation theory. Here, we employ symmetry-breaking degrees of freedom as synthetic dimensions, to demonstrate that symmetry-broken systems systematically exhibit a new class of symmetries and selection rules. These selection rules determine the scaling of a system's observables (to all orders in the strength of the symmetry-breaking perturbation) as it transitions from symmetric to symmetry-broken. We specifically analyze periodically driven (Floquet) systems subject to two driving fields, where the first field imposes a spatio-temporal symmetry, and the second field breaks it, imposing a symmetry in synthetic dimensions. We tabulate the resulting synthetic symmetries for (2+1)D Floquet group symmetries and derive the corresponding selection rules for high harmonic generation (HHG) and above-threshold ionization (ATI). Finally, we observe experimentally HHG selection rules imposed by symmetries in synthetic dimensions. The new class of symmetries & selection rules extends the scope of existing symmetry breaking spectroscopy techniques, opening new routes for ultrafast spectroscopy of phonon-polarization, spin-orbit coupling, and more.</div>

<div class="abstract">The non-trivial magnetic texture in real space gives rise to the intriguing phenomenon of topological Hall effect (THE), which is relatively less explored in topological semimetals. Here, we report large THE in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state in single crystals of EuAgAs, an AFM Dirac semimetal. EuAgAs hosts AFM ground state below $T_N$ = 12 K with a weak ferromagnetic component. The in-plane isothermal magnetization below $T_N$ exhibits a weak metamagnetic transition. We also observe chiral anomaly induced positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity which indicates a Weyl fermion state under applied magnetic field. The first-principles calculations reveal that EuAgAs is an AFM Dirac semimetal with a pair of Dirac cones, and therefore, a Weyl semimetailic state can be realized under time-reversal symmetry breaking via an applied magnetic field. Our study establishes that EuAgAs is a novel system for exploiting the interplay of band topology and the topology of the magnetic texture.</div>

<div class="abstract">Optical control of Dirac surface states (SS) in topological insulators (TI) remains one of the most challenging problems governing their potential applications in novel electronic and spintronic devices. Here, using visible-range transient absorption spectroscopy exploiting ~340 nm (~3.65 eV) pumping, we provide evidence for dynamic opening a gap in Dirac SS of the thin-film 3D TI Bi2Se3, which has been induced by the dynamic Rashba effect occurring in the film bulk with increasing optical pumping power (photoexcited carrier density). The observed effect appears through the transient absorption band associated with inverse-bremsstrahlung-type free carrier absorption in the gapped Dirac SS. We have also recognized experimental signatures of the existence of the higher energy Dirac SS in the 3D TI Bi2Se3 (in addition to those known as SS1 and SS2) with energies of ~2.7 and ~3.9 eV (SS3 and SS4). It is evidenced that the dynamic gap opening has the same effect on the Dirac SS occurred at any energies.</div>

<div class="abstract">A single-spin qubit placed near the surface of a conductor acquires an additional contribution to its $1/T_1$ relaxation rate due to magnetic noise created by electric current fluctuations in the material. We analyze this technique as a wireless probe of superconductivity in atomically thin two dimensional materials. At temperatures $T \lesssim T_c$, the dominant contribution to the qubit relaxation rate is due to transverse electric current fluctuations arising from quasiparticle excitations. We demonstrate that this method enables detection of metal-to-superconductor transitions, as well as investigation of the symmetry of the superconducting gap function, through the noise scaling with temperature. We show that scaling of the noise with sample-probe distance provides a window into the non-local quasi-static conductivity of superconductors, both clean and disordered. At low temperatures the quasiparticle fluctuations get suppressed, yet the noise can be substantial due to resonant contributions from collective longitudinal modes, such as plasmons in monolayers and Josephson plasmons in bilayers. Potential experimental implications are discussed.</div>

<div class="abstract">We experimentally investigate the effect of electron temperature on transport in the two-dimensional Dirac surface states of the three-dimensional topological insulator HgTe. We find that around the minimal conductivity point, where both electrons and holes are present, heating the carriers with a DC current results in a non-monotonic differential resistance of narrow channels. We show that the observed initial increase in resistance can be attributed to electron-hole scattering, while the decrease follows naturally from the change in Fermi energy of the charge carriers. Both effects are governed dominantly by a van Hove singularity in the bulk valence band. The results demonstrate the importance of interband electron-hole scattering in the transport properties of topological insulators.</div>

<div class="abstract">Chiral interaction between light and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) has recently drawn enormous scientific attention. The optical selection rules of these atomically thin semiconductors allow the attribution of a pseudospin to the TMDs' valleys, which can be coherently manipulated for information processing using polarized light. The interaction of TMDs with circularly and linearly polarized light creates the valley polarization and coherence, respectively. With a full Stokes polarization analysis of light emitted from WS2 monolayer flakes, we conclusively confirm the existence of coherence between its valleys. We observe spatial heterogeneity in photoluminescence intensity, valley polarization and valley coherence. The discovery of an inverse proportional relationship between photoluminescence intensity and both valley polarization and coherence, reveals a correlation between the (non-)radiative decay rate and the valley hopping. The temperature dependence confirms the phononic nature of valley depolarization and decoherence, that may be caused by strain and the presence of defects.</div>

<div class="abstract">Deterministic photon-photon gates enable the controlled generation of entanglement between mobile carriers of quantum information. Such gates have thus far been exclusively realized in the optical domain and by relying on post-selection. Here, we present a non-post-selected, deterministic, photon-photon gate in the microwave frequency range realized using superconducting circuits. We emit photonic qubits from a source chip and route those qubits to a gate chip with which we realize a universal gate set by combining controlled absorption and re-emission with single-qubit gates and qubit-photon controlled-phase gates. We measure quantum process fidelities of $75\,\%$ for single- and of $57\,\%$ for two-qubit gates, limited mainly by radiation loss and decoherence. This universal gate set has a wide range of potential applications in superconducting quantum networks.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, valley coherence degrades rapidly due to a combination of fast scattering and inter-valley exchange interaction. This leads to a sub-picosecond valley coherence time, making coherent manipulation of exciton a highly formidable task. Using monolayer MoS$_2$ sandwiched between top and bottom graphene, here we demonstrate perfect valley coherence by observing 100% degree of linear polarization of excitons in steady state photoluminescence. This is achieved in this unique design through a combined effect of (a) suppression in exchange interaction due to enhanced dielectric screening, (b) reduction in exciton lifetime due to a fast inter-layer transfer to graphene, and (c) operating in the motional narrowing regime. We disentangle the role of the key parameters affecting valley coherence by using a combination of calculation (solutions of Bethe-Salpeter and steady-state Maialle-Silva-Sham equations) and choice of systematic design of experiments using four different stacks with varying screening and exciton lifetime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which the valley coherence timescale has been significantly enhanced beyond the exciton radiative lifetime in monolayer semiconductors.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>M. Arabikhah, A. Saffarzadeh</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Based on a self-consistent $t$-matrix approximation, we explore the influence of magnetic and nonmagnetic doping on the surface electronic states and conductivity of topological insulators. We show that warping parameter has a crucial impact on the density of states and dc conductivity of the doped surfaces. As the warping strength is increased, the surface density of states at high energies is suppressed and the resonant states induced by impurities in the vicinity of the Dirac point gradually disappear. It is found that nonmagnetic impurities break electron-hole symmetry at low warping strength, while the symmetry remains unchanged when the surface is magnetically doped. Our findings reveal that surface conductivity can be controlled by tuning the doping, the direction of external magnetic field and that of impurity magnetic moments. Also, the surface conductivity features in topological insulators with warped energy dispersions are not significantly affected by the presence of impurities compared to that of materials with circular energy contour.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We introduce lattice gauge theories which describe three-dimensional, gapped quantum phases exhibiting the phenomenology of both conventional three-dimensional topological orders and fracton orders, starting from a finite group $G$, a choice of an Abelian normal subgroup $N$, and a choice of foliation structure. These hybrid fracton orders -- examples of which were introduced in arXiv:2102.09555 -- can also host immobile, point-like excitations that are non-Abelian, and therefore give rise to a protected degeneracy. We construct solvable lattice models for these orders which interpolate between a conventional, three-dimensional $G$ gauge theory and a pure fracton order, by varying the choice of normal subgroup $N$. We demonstrate that certain universal data of the topological excitations and their mobilities are directly related to the choice of $G$ and $N$, and also present complementary perspectives on these orders: certain orders may be obtained by gauging a global symmetry which enriches a particular fracton order, by either fractionalizing on or permuting the excitations with restricted mobility, while certain hybrid orders can be obtained by condensing excitations in a stack of initially decoupled, two-dimensional topological orders.</div>

<div class="abstract">Nuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing, because of their exceptional quantum coherence and atomic-scale footprint. However, the full potential of nuclear spins for quantum computing has not yet been realized, due to the lack of high-fidelity multi-qubit operations, and of pathways to distribute quantum information among nuclei within a scalable device. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted $^{31}$P nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin, and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)%. The quantum operations are precisely characterised using gate set tomography (GST), yielding one-qubit gate fidelities up to 99.93(3)% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.21(14)%. The GST analysis provides unprecedented details on the nature of the errors -- including the emergence of correlated and entangling errors -- which will be crucial for developing fault-tolerant quantum processors. We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)% fidelity. Since electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons or physically shuttled across different locations, these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using nuclear spins.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Second-order topological semimetals (SOTSMs) is featured with the presence of hinge Fermi arc. How to generate SOTSMs in different systems has attracted much attention. We here propose a scheme to create exotic SOTSMs by periodic driving. It is found that novel Dirac SOTSMs with a widely tunable number of nodes and hinge Fermi arcs, the adjacent nodes with same chirality, and the coexisting nodal points and nodal loops can be generated at ease by the periodic driving. When the time-reversal symmetry is broken, our scheme also permits us to realize an exotic hybrid-order Weyl semimetals with the coexisting hinge and surface Fermi arcs. The multiplicity of the zero- and $\pi/T$-mode Weyl points endows our system more colorful 2D sliced topological phases, which can be any combination of normal insulator, Chern insulator, and SOTI, than the static case. Enriching the family of topological semimetals, our scheme supplies a convenient way to artificially synthesize and control exotic topological phases by periodic driving.</div>

<div class="abstract">Quantum dots have sharply defined energy levels, which can be used for high resolution energy spectroscopy when integrated in tunneling circuitry. Here we report dot-assisted spectroscopy measurements of the superconductor $NbSe_2$, using a van der Waals device consisting of a vertical stack of $graphene-MoS_2-NbSe_2$. The $MoS_2$ tunnel barriers host naturally occurring defects which function as quantum dots, allowing transport via resonant tunneling. The dot energies are tuned by an electric field exerted by a back-gate, which penetrates the graphene source electrode. Scanning the dot potential across the superconductor Fermi energy, we reproduce the $NbSe_2$ density of states which exhibits a well-resolved two-gap spectrum. Surprisingly, we find that the dot-assisted current is dominated by the lower energy feature of the two $NbSe_2$ gaps, possibly due to a selection rule which favors coupling between the dots and the orbitals which exhibit this gap.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>L. Li, C. H. Lee</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The notion of a band gap is ubiquitous in the characterization of matter. Particularly interesting are pseudo-gaps, which are enigmatic regions of very low density of states that have been linked to novel phenomena like high temperature superconductivity. In this work, we discover a new non-Hermitian mechanism that induces pseudo-gaps when boundaries are introduced in a lattice. It generically occurs due to the interference between two or more asymmetric pumping channels, and possess no analog in Hermitian systems. Mathematically, it can be visualized as being created by divergences of spectral flow in the complex energy plane, analogous to how sharp edges creates divergent electric fields near an electrical conductor. A non-Hermitian pseudo-gap can host symmetry-protected mid-gap modes like ordinary topological gaps, but the mid-gap modes are extended instead of edge-localized, and exhibit extreme sensitivity to symmetry-breaking perturbations. Surprisingly, pseudo-gaps can also host an integer number of edge modes even though the pseudo-bands possess fractional topological windings, or even no well-defined Chern number at all, in the marginal case of a phase transition point. Challenging conventional notions of topological bulk-boundary correspondences and even the very concept of a band, pseudo-gaps post profound implications that extend to many-body settings, such as fractional Chern insulators.</div>

<div class="abstract">We study the effects caused by Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling over the thermoelectric transport properties of a single-electron transistor, viz., a quantum dot connected to one-dimensional leads. Using linear response theory and employing the numerical renormalization group method, we calculate the thermopower, electrical and thermal conductances, dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, and study the Wiedemann-Franz law, showing their temperature maps. Our results for all those properties indicate that spin-orbit coupling drives the system into the Kondo regime. We show that the thermoelectric transport properties, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, obey the expected universality of the Kondo strong coupling fixed point. In addition, our results show a notable increase in the thermoelectric figure of merit, caused by the spin-orbit coupling in the one-dimensional quantum dot leads.</div>

Here we show that on a suitably engineered bilayer fractional quantum Hall edge, which is an experimentally available platform, the neutral modes can be gapped while leaving the desired charge modes gapless. The gapping mechanism is akin to a "four-particle pairing" superconductivity. Our considered bilayer structure can be shaped as an anyonic interferometer.

This flexibility is advantageous for valleytronics, where information is encoded in the valleys of the band structure when intervalley scattering is weak. However, if numerous Weyl cones coexist the encoded information can decohere rapidly because of band mixing.

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Dirac points are found to emerge due to the crossing of bands in the electronic structure of bilayer graphene for configurations in which the alignment between two hexagonal lattices preserves the parallelism of the armchair/zigzag lines between two layers. On the base of electronic calculations using a tight-binding model for the $\pi$ bands it is shown that the crossing of the energy-band dispersion curves occurs in the vicinity of the corner points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Group representation theory analysis confirms the emergence of such Dirac points. It is demonstrated that the band crossings at generic $\mathbf{k}$ points are guaranteed by the compatibility relations between the symmetries of eigenstates at the high-symmetry $\mathbf{k}$ points in the Brillouin zone. The presence of Dirac points governs the geometrical properties of the energy surfaces, and thus the topological structure of the Fermi energy surface and the energy spectrum.</div>

<div class="abstract">Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) provides an example of a system in which the interplay of interlayer interactions and superlattice structure impacts electron transport in a variety of non-trivial ways and gives rise to a plethora of interesting effects. Understanding the mechanisms of electron scattering in TBG has, however, proven challenging, raising many questions about the origins of resistivity in this system. Here we show that TBG exhibits high-temperature magnetooscillations originating from the scattering of charge carriers between TBG minivalleys. The amplitude of these oscillations reveals that interminivalley scattering is strong, and its characteristic time scale is comparable to that of its intraminivalley counterpart. Furthermore, by exploring the temperature dependence of these oscillations, we estimate the electron-electron collision rate in TBG and find that it exceeds that of monolayer graphene. Our study demonstrates the consequences of the relatively small size of the superlattice Brillouin zone and Fermi velocity reduction on lateral transport in TBG.</div>

During 70 hours in the spectrum measurement, split width fluctuates but the middle frequency of the split is constant.

<div class="abstract">We theoretically study the effect of magnetic moir\'e superlattice on the topological surface states by introducing a continuum model of Dirac electrons with a single Dirac cone moving in the time-reversal symmetry breaking periodic pontential. The Zeeman-type moir\'e potentials generically gap out the moir\'e surface Dirac cones and give rise to isolated flat Chern minibands with Chern number $\pm1$. This result provides a promising platform for realizing the time-reversal breaking correlated topological phases. In a $C_6$ periodic potential, when the scalar $U_0$ and Zeeman $\Delta_1$ moir\'e potential strengths are equal to each other, we find that energetically the first three bands of $\Gamma$-valley moir\'e surface electrons are non-degenerate and realize i) an $s$-orbital model on a honeycomb lattice, ii) a degenerate $p_x,p_y$-orbitals model on a honeycomb lattice, and iii) a hybridized $sd^2$-orbital model on a kagome lattice, where moir\'e surface Dirac cones in these bands emerge. When $U_0\neq\Delta_1$, the difference between the two moir\'e potential serves as an effective spin-orbit coupling and opens a topological gap in the emergent moir\'e surface Dirac cones.</div>

In this work we show that in certain classes of two-dimensional superconductors with antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, Cooper pairs acquire a finite momentum upon the application of an in-plane magnetic field, and as a result, critical currents in the direction parallel and antiparallel to the Cooper pair momentum become unequal. This supercurrent diode effect is also manifested in the polarity-dependence of in-plane critical fields induced by a supercurrent. These nonreciprocal effects may be found in polar SrTiO$_3$ film, few-layer MoTe$_2$ in the $T_d$ phase, and twisted bilayer graphene in which the valley degrees of freedom plays the role analogous to spin.</div>

<div class="abstract">We develop a theory of circular photogalvanic effect in non-gyrotropic two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers under interband optical transitions. Oblique incidence of circularly-polarized electromagnetic field or normal incidence of elliptically polarized electromagnetic field is assumed. In contrast to the linear-in-intensity conventional photogalvanic effect, the effect considered here arises in the second intensity order. The effect is conditioned by i) the predominant population of the valleys by the circular in-plane electromagnetic field component and ii) the direct drift of the photo-excited carriers by the linear-polarized in-plane electromagnetic field component in the presence of trigonal valley asymmetry.</div>

<div class="abstract">We study the Hall conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas under an inhomogeneous magnetic field $B(x)$. First, we prove using the quantum kinetic theory that an odd magnetic field can lead to a purely nonlinear Hall response. Second, considering a real-space magnetic dipole consisting of a sign-changing magnetic field and based on numerical semiclassical dynamics, we unveil a parametric resonance involving the cyclotron ratio and a characteristic width of $B(x)$, which can greatly enhance the Hall response. Different from previous mechanisms that rely on the bulk Berry curvature dipole, here, the effect largely stems from boundary states associated with the real-space magnetic dipole. Our findings pave a new way to engineer current rectification and higher harmonic generation in two-dimensional materials having or not crystal inversion symmetry.</div>

<div class="abstract">Topological Weyl semimetals have been attracting broad interest. Recently, a new type of Weyl point with topological charge of $4$, termed as charge-4 Weyl point (C-4 WP), was proposed in spinless systems. Here, we show the minimum symmetry requirement for C-4 WP is point group $T$ together with ${\cal T}$ symmetry or point group $O$. We establish a minimum tight-binding model for C-4 WP on a cubic lattice with time-reversal symmetry and without spin-orbit coupling effect. This lattice model is a two-band one, ontaining only one pair of C-4 WPs with opposite chirality around Fermi level. Based on both the low-energy effective Hamiltonian and the minimum lattice model, we investigate the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of C-4 WP. Several chirality-dependent properties are revealed, such as chiral Landau bands, quantized circular photogalvanic effect and quadruple-helicoid surface arc states. Furthermore, we predict that under symmetry breaking, various exotic topological phases can evolve out of C-4 WPs. Our work not only reveals several interesting phenomena associate to C-4 WPs, but also provides a simple and ideal lattice model of C-4 WP, which will be helpful for the subsequent study on C-4 WPs.</div>
