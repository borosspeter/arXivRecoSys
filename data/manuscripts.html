<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Quantum dots are recognized as a suitable platform for studying thermodynamic phenomena involving single electronic charges and spins in nano-scale devices. However, such a thermodynamic system is usually driven by electron reservoirs at different temperatures, not by a lattice temperature gradient. We report on experimental observations of charge-spin cooperative dynamics in transitions of two-electron spin states in a GaAs double quantum dot located in a non-equilibrium phonon environment. Enhancements in the spin-flip processes are observed, originating from phonon excitation combined with the spin-orbit interaction. In addition, due to the spatial gradient of phonon density between the dots, the spin-flip rate during an inter-dot electron tunnel from a hot to a cold dot is more enhanced than in the other direction, resulting in accumulation of parallel spin states in the double dot.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Spin-Valley Qubit Dynamics In Exchange Coupled Silicon Quantum Dots</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>D. Buterakos, S. D. Sarma</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> The presence of valley states is a significant obstacle to realizing quantum information technologies in Silicon quantum dots, as leakage into alternate valley states can introduce errors into the computation. We use a perturbative analytical approach to study the dynamics of exchange-coupled quantum dots with valley degrees of freedom. We show that if the valley splitting is large and electrons are not properly initialized to valley eigenstates, then time evolution of the system will lead to spin-valley entanglement. Spin-valley entanglement will also occur if the valley splitting is small and electrons are not initialized to the same valley state. Additionally, we show that for small valley splitting, spin-valley entanglement does not affect measurement probabilities of two-qubit systems; however, systems with more qubits will be affected. This means that two-qubit gate fidelities measured in two-qubit systems may miss the effects of valley degrees of freedom. Our work shows how the existence of valleys may adversely affect multiqubit fidelities even when the system temperature is very low.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Little-Parks oscillations of a hollow superconducting cylinder are of interest for flux-driven topological superconductivity in single Rashba nanowires. The oscillations are typically symmetric in the orientation of the applied magnetic flux. Using double InAs nanowires coated by an epitaxial superconducting Al shell which, despite the non-centro-symmetric geometry, behaves effectively as one hollow cylinder, we demonstrate that a small misalignment of the applied parallel field with respect to the axis of the nanowires can produce field-asymmetric Little-Parks oscillations. These are revealed by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the misaligned parallel field direction. The asymmetry occurs in both the destructive regime, in which superconductivity is destroyed for half-integer quanta of flux through the shell, and in the non-destructive regime, where superconductivity is depressed but not fully destroyed at these flux values.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Isolated and hybrid bilayer graphene rings</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>M. Mirzakhani, F. M. Peeters</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Using the continuum model, we investigate the electronic properties of two types of bilayer graphene ring (BLGR) geometries: (i) an isolated BLGR and (ii) a monolayer graphene (MLG) ring put on top of an infinite graphene sheet. Solving the Dirac-Weyl equation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and applying infinite-mass boundary condition at the ring boundaries, we obtain analytical results for the energy levels and corresponding wave spinors for both structures. Our results show that the presence of interface boundary in a hybrid BLGR modifies drastically the energy levels as compared to that of an isolated BLGR. The intervalley symmetry $ E^K_e (m) = -E^{K'}_h(m) $ between the electron (e) and hole (h) states ($ m $ being the angular momentum quantum number) is found for the energy spectrum of an isolated BLGR, while it is broken for the hybrid BLGR. Our analytical results agree with those obtained within the tight-binding model (TBM). Sizeable and magnetically tunable band gap, in contrast to that in the zero-width BLGR model, is predicted for both ring structures, which experimentally can be measured in, e.g., magnetotransport measurements.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Relating the topology of Dirac Hamiltonians to quantum geometry: When   the quantum metric dictates Chern numbers and winding numbers</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>B. Mera, A. Zhang, N. Goldman</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Quantum geometry has emerged as a central and ubiquitous concept in quantum sciences, with direct consequences on quantum metrology and many-body quantum physics. In this context, two fundamental geometric quantities play complementary roles: the Fubini-Study metric, which introduces a notion of distance between quantum states defined over a parameter space, and the Berry curvature associated with Berry-phase effects and topological band structures. In fact, recent studies have revealed direct relations between these two important quantities, suggesting that topological properties can, in special cases, be deduced from the quantum metric. In this work, we establish general and exact relations between the quantum metric and the topological invariants of generic Dirac Hamiltonians. In particular, we demonstrate that topological indices (Chern numbers or winding numbers) are bounded by the quantum volume determined by the quantum metric. Our theoretical framework, which builds on the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, is applicable to topological insulators and semimetals of arbitrary spatial dimensions, with or without chiral symmetry. This work clarifies the role of the Fubini-Study metric in topological states of matter, suggesting unexplored topological responses and metrological applications in a broad class of quantum-engineered systems.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> We present a review of topological electronic materials discovery in crystalline solids from the prediction of the first 2D and 3D topological insulators (TIs) through the recently introduced methods that have facilitated large-scale searches for topological materials. We first briefly review the concepts of band theory and topology, as well as the experimental methods used to demonstrate nontrivial topology in solid-state materials. We then review the past 15 years of topological materials discovery, including the identification of the first nonmagnetic TIs, topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), and topological semimetals (TSMs). Most recently, through complete analyses of symmetry-allowed band structures - including the theory of Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) - researchers have determined crystal-symmetry-enhanced Wilson-loop and complete symmetry-based indicators for nonmagnetic topological phases, leading to the discovery of higher-order TCIs and TSMs. Lastly, we discuss the recent application of TQC and related methods to high-throughput materials discovery, which revealed that over half of all of the known stoichiometric, solid-state, nonmagnetic materials are topological at the Fermi level, over 85% of the known stoichiometric materials host energetically isolated topological bands, and that just under $2/3$ of the energetically isolated bands in known materials carry the stable topology of a TI or TCI. We conclude by discussing future venues for the identification and manipulation of solid-state topological phases, including charge-density-wave compounds, magnetic materials, and 2D few-layer devices.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Model for missing Shapiro steps due to bias-dependent resistance</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>S. R. Mudi, S. M. Frolov</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Majorana zero modes are predicted in several solid state systems such as hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures and topological insulators coupled to superconductors. One of the expected signatures of Majorana modes is the fractional 4$\pi$ Josephson effect. Evidence in favor of this effect often comes from a.c. Josephson effect measurements and focuses on the observation of missing first or higher odd-numbered Shapiro steps. However, the disappearance of the odd Shapiro steps has also been reported in conventional Josephson junctions where no Majorana modes are expected. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model that displays suppression of the odd Shapiro steps. We perform resistively-shunted junction model calculations and introduce peaks in differential resistance as function of the bias current. In the presence of only the standard 2$\pi$ Josephson current, for chosen values of peak positions and amplitudes, we can suppress the odd Shapiro steps, or any steps, thus providing a possible explanation for the observation of missing Shapiro steps.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>M. Noro, J. Tanaka, T. Yokoyama, S. Murakami</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Based on the similarity between the chiral nanotube and the classical solenoid, we study chiral transport along the circumferential direction in a carbon nanotube. We calculate the chiral conductivity, representing a circumferential current induced by an electric field along the nanotube axis for various chiralities of carbon nanotubes. We find that the chiral conductivity in a chiral nanotube is in general non zero, and oscillates as a function of the Fermi energy. This oscillating behavior is attributed to the subband structure of the nanotubes and the warping of the Fermi surfaces.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Spin Hall and inverse spin galvanic effects in graphene with strong   interfacial spin-orbit coupling: a quasi-classical Green's function approach</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>C. Monaco, A. Ferreira, R. Raimondi</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> van der Waals heterostructures assembled from atomically thin crystals are ideal model systems to study spin-orbital coupled transport because they exhibit a strong interplay between spin, lattice and valley degrees of freedom that can be manipulated by strain, electric bias and proximity effects. The recently predicted spin-helical regime in graphene on transition metal dichalcogenides, in which spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom are locked together [M. Offidani et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 196801 (2017)], suggests their potential application in spintronics. Here, by deriving an Eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical Green's function of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in the presence of} spin-orbit coupling\textcolor{black}{{} (SOC) and scalar disorder, we obtain analytical expressions for the dc spin galvanic susceptibility and spin Hall conductivity in the spin-helical regime. Our results disclose a sign change in the spin Hall angle (SHA) when the Fermi energy relative to the Dirac point matches the Bychkov-Rashba energy scale, irrespective of the magnitude of the spin-valley interaction imprinted on the graphene layer. The behavior of the SHA is connected to a reversal of the total internal angular momentum of Bloch electrons that reflects the spin-pseudospin entanglement induced by SOC. We also show that the charge-spin conversion reaches a maximum when the Fermi level lies at the edge of the spin-minority band in agreement with previous findings. Both features are fingerprints of spin-helical Dirac fermions and suggest a direct way to estimate the strength of proximity-induced SOC from transport data. The relevance of these findings for interpreting recent spin-charge conversion measurements in nonlocal spin-valve geometry is also discussed.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>A. Rossi, N. W. Hendrickx, A. Sammak, M. Veldhorst, G. Scappucci, M. Kataoka</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Single-charge pumps are the main candidates for quantum-based standards of the unit ampere because they can generate accurate and quantized electric currents. In order to approach the metrological requirements in terms of both accuracy and speed of operation, in the past decade there has been a focus on semiconductor-based devices. The use of a variety of semiconductor materials enables the universality of charge pump devices to be tested, a highly desirable demonstration for metrology, with GaAs and Si pumps at the forefront of these tests. Here, we show that pumping can be achieved in a yet unexplored semiconductor, i.e. germanium. We realise a single-hole pump with a tunable-barrier quantum dot electrostatically defined at a Ge/SiGe heterostructure interface. We observe quantized current plateaux by driving the system with a single sinusoidal drive up to a frequency of 100 MHz. The operation of the prototype was affected by accidental formation of multiple dots, probably due to disorder potential, and random charge fluctuations. We suggest straightforward refinements of the fabrication process to improve pump characteristics in future experiments.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Dynamics of superconducting qubit relaxation times</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>M. Carroll, S. Rosenblatt, P. Jurcevic, I. Lauer, A. Kandala</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> Superconducting qubits are a leading candidate for quantum computing but display temporal fluctuations in their energy relaxation times T1. This introduces instabilities in multi-qubit device performance. Furthermore, autocorrelation in these time fluctuations introduces challenges for obtaining representative measures of T1 for process optimization and device screening. These T1 fluctuations are often attributed to time varying coupling of the qubit to defects, putative two level systems (TLSs). In this work, we develop a technique to probe the spectral and temporal dynamics of T1 in single junction transmons by repeated T1 measurements in the frequency vicinity of the bare qubit transition, via the AC-Stark effect. Across 10 qubits, we observe strong correlations between the mean T1 averaged over approximately nine months and a snapshot of an equally weighted T1 average over the Stark shifted frequency range. These observations are suggestive of an ergodic-like spectral diffusion of TLSs dominating T1, and offer a promising path to more rapid T1 characterization for device screening and process optimization.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Title:</b> Robustness of Helical Edge States Under Edge Reconstruction</font><br />
<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>N. John, A. D. Maestro, B. Rosenow</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> The helical edge states of time-reversal invariant two-dimensional topological insulators are protected against backscattering in idealized models. In more realistic scenarios with a shallow confining potential at the sample boundary, additional strongly interacting edge states may arise, that could interfere with the topological protection of edge conduction. We find that interaction effects within the reconstructed edges are well described by the Luttinger liquid model. While interactions between this Luttinger liquid and the helical edge states can in principle give rise to dynamical spin polarization and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that random spin-orbit coupling strongly suppresses such dynamical spin polarization, resulting in the persistence of quantized edge conduction.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>T. Simons, A. Romito, D. Meidan</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> We analyze the conductance of a one-dimensional topological superconductor periodically driven to host Floquet Majorana zero-modes for different configurations of coupling to external leads. We compare the conductance of constantly coupled leads, as in standard transport experiments, with the stroboscopic conductance of pulsed coupling to leads used to identify a scattering matrix topological index for periodically driven systems. We find that the sum of DC conductance at voltages multiples of the driving frequency is quantitatively close to the stroboscopic conductance at all voltage biases. This is consistent with previous work which indicated that the summed conductance at zero/pi resonance is quantized. We quantify the difference between the two in terms of the width of their respective resonances and analyze that difference for two different stroboscopic driving protocols of the Kitaev chain. While the quantitative differences are protocol-dependent, we find that generically the discrepancy is larger when the zero mode weight at the end of the chain depends strongly on the offset time between the driving cycle and the pulsed coupling period.<br />

<b><font size="+1">Authors:</font></b> <i>X. Feng, X. Xu, Z. He, R. Peng, Y. Dai, B. Huang, Y. Ma</i><br />
<b><font size="+1">Abstract:</font></b> 2D materials with valley-related multiple Hall effect are both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing to explore novel phenomena and applications, but have been largely overlooked up to date. Here, using first-principles calculations, we present that valley related multiple Hall effect can exist in single-layer VSi2P4. We identify single-layer VSi2P4 as a ferromagnetic semiconductor with out-of-plane magnetization and valley physics. Arising from the joint effect of inversion symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking, the exotic spontaneous valley polarization occurs in single-layer VSi2P4, thus facilitating the observation of anomalous valley Hall effect. Moreover, under external strain, band inversion can occur at only one of the valleys of single-layer VSi2P4, enabling the long-sought valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect, and meanwhile the anomalous valley Hall effect is well preserved.. Our work not only enriches the research on valley-related multiple Hall effect, but also opens a new avenue for exploring valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect.<br />
