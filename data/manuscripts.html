<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We study possible superconducting states in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, assuming an on-site pairing potential that includes both intra- and inter-orbital terms. We find that if the mirror symmetry with respect to the system's plane is broken (e.g., by a substrate), this type of pairing can give rise to unconventional superconductivity, including time-reversal-invariant nodal and fully gapped topological phases. Using a multi-orbital renormalization group procedure, we show how these phases may result from the interplay between the local Coulomb repulsion, Hund's rule coupling, and phonon-mediated attraction. In particular, for a range of interaction parameters, the system transitions from a trivial phase to a nodal phase and finally to a gapped topological phase upon increasing the strength of the mirror symmetry breaking term.</div>

<div class="abstract">Spin transport via magnon diffusion in magnetic insulators is important for a broad range of spin-based phenomena and devices. However, the absence of the magnon equivalent of an electric force is a bottleneck. In this work, we demonstrate the controlled generation of magnon drift currents in yttrium iron garnet/platinum heterostructures. By performing electrical injection and detection of incoherent magnons, we find magnon drift currents that stem from the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We can further control the magnon drift by the orientation of the magnetic field. The drift current changes the magnon propagation length by up to $\pm$ 6 % relative to diffusion. We generalize the magnonic spin transport theory to include a finite drift velocity resulting from any inversion asymmetric interaction, and obtain results consistent with our experiments.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In thermodynamic equilibrium, current in metallic systems is carried by electronic states near the Fermi energy whereas the filled bands underneath contribute little to conduction. Here we describe a very different regime in which carrier distribution in graphene and its superlattices is shifted so far from equilibrium that the filled bands start playing an essential role, leading to a critical-current behavior. The criticalities develop upon the velocity of electron flow reaching the Fermi velocity. Key signatures of the out-of-equilibrium state are current-voltage characteristics resembling those of superconductors, sharp peaks in differential resistance, sign reversal of the Hall effect, and a marked anomaly caused by the Schwinger-like production of hot electron-hole plasma. The observed behavior is expected to be common for all graphene-based superlattices.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>M. Milivojevic</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Strong direct Rashba spin-orbit coupling in Si, Ge, and Ge/Si core/shell nanowire quantum dot (QD) allows for all electrical manipulation of the hole spin qubit. Motivated by this fact, we analyze different fabrication-dependent properties of nanowires, such as orientation, cross section, and the presence of strain, with the goal to find the material and geometry that enables the fastest qubit manipulation, whose speed can be identified using the Rabi frequency. We show that QD in nanowires with a circular cross section (cNWs) enables much weaker driving of the hole spin qubit than QDs embedded in square profile nanowires (sNWs). Assuming the orientation of the Si nanowire that maximizes the spin-orbit effects, our calculations predict that the Rabi frequencies of the hole spin qubits inside Ge and Si sNW QD have comparable strengths for weak electric fields. The global maximum of Rabi frequency is found in Si sNW QD for strong electric fields, putting this setup ahead of others in creating the hole spin qubit. Finally, we demonstrate that strain in Si/Ge core/shell nanowire QD decreases the Rabi frequency. In cNW QD, this effect is weak; in sNW QD, it is possible to optimize the impact of strain with the appropriate tuning of the electric field strength.</div>

<div class="abstract">The topological properties and intrinsic anomalous Hall effect of CsCl-type ferromagnets GdZn and GdCd have been studied based on first-principles electronic structure calculations. According to the calculated band structures, both GdZn and GdCd host nodal lines near the Fermi level. Once the magnetization breaks the mirror symmetries, the nodal lines are gapped. This can create a huge Berry curvature. A large anomalous Hall effect is then generated when the Fermi level resides within the opened gaps of the nodal lines. Our works indicate that GdZn and GdCd can provide a promising platform for exploring the interplay between topological property and magnetism.</div>

<div class="abstract">Motivated by the recent experimental realization of twisted trilayer graphene and the observed superconductivity that is associated with its flat bands at specific angles, we study trilayer graphene under the influence of different forms of light in the non-interacting limit. Specifically, we study four different types of stacking configurations with a single twisted layer. In all four cases, we study the impact of circularly polarized light and longitudinal light coming from a waveguide. We derive effective time-independent Floquet Hamiltonians and review light-induced changes to the band structure. For circularly polarized light, we find band flattening effects as well as band gap openings. We emphasize that there is as rich band topology, which we summarize in Chern number maps that are different for all four studied lattice configurations. The case of a so-called ABC stacked top layer twist is especially rich and shows a different phase diagram depending on the handedness of the circularly polarized light. Consequently, we propose an experiment where this difference in typologies could be captured via optical conductivity measurements. In contrast for the case of longitudinal light that is coming from a waveguide, we find that the band structure is very closely related to the equilibrium one but the magic angles can be tuned in-situ by varying the intensity of the incident beam of light.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>T. Shah, F. Marquardt, V. Peano</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">A large set of recent experiments has been exploring topological transport in bosonic systems, e.g. of photons or phonons. In the vast majority, time-reversal symmetry is preserved, and band structures are engineered by a suitable choice of geometry, to produce topologically nontrivial bandgaps in the vicinity of high-symmetry points. However, this leaves open the possibility of large-quasimomentum backscattering, destroying the topological protection. Up to now, it has been unclear what precisely are the conditions where this effect can be sufficiently suppressed. In the present work, we introduce a comprehensive semiclassical theory of tunneling transitions in momentum space, describing backscattering for one of the most important system classes, based on the valley Hall effect. We predict that even for a smooth domain wall effective scattering centres develop at locations determined by both the local slope of the wall and the energy. Moreover, our theory provides a quantitative analysis of the exponential suppression of the overall reflection amplitude with increasing domain wall smoothness.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The theory of symmetry indicators has enabled database searches for topological materials in normal conducting phases, which has led to several encyclopedic topological material databases. Here, based on recently developed symmetry indicators for superconductors, we report our comprehensive search for topological and nodal superconductors among nonmagnetic materials in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. A myriad of topological superconductors with exotic boundary states are discovered. When materials are symmetry-enforced nodal superconductors, positions and shapes of the nodes are also identified. These data are aggregated at Database of Topological and Nodal Supercoductors. We also provide a subroutine Topological Supercon, which allows users to examine the topological nature in the superconducting phase of any material themselves by uploading the result of first-principles calculations as an input. Our database and subroutine, when combined with experiments, will help us understand the unconventional pairing mechanism and facilitate realizations of the long-sought Majorana fermions promising for topological quantum computations.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Nonequilibrium topological matter has been a fruitful topic of both theoretical and experimental interest. A great variety of exotic topological phases unavailable in static systems may emerge under nonequilibrium situations, often challenging our physical intuitions. How to locate the borders between different nonequilibrium topological phases is an important issue to facilitate topological characterization and further understand phase transition behaviors. In this work, we develop an unsupervised machine-learning protocol to distinguish between different Floquet (periodically driven) topological phases, by incorporating the system's dynamics within one driving period, adiabatic deformation in the time dimension, plus the system's symmetry all into our machine learning algorithm. Results from two rich case studies indicate that machine learning is able to reliably reveal intricate topological phase boundaries and can hence be a powerful tool to discover novel topological matter afforded by the time dimension.</div>

In this article the micro-flakes of single-crystalline topological insulators Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 are explored through physical parameter measurement at low temperatures and thereby the charge carrier dynamics are investigated at 5K to study the various optical transitions related to these surface states. The magnetoresistance is experimentally investigated at temperatures of 5K and 100K for a field range of 1Tesla. The occurrence of the weak anti-localization effect predicts the presence of topologically protected surface states in the systems. Further, the ultrafast femtosecond transient reflectance spectroscopy is performed at different temperatures, varying from a room temperature (300K) to a low temperature of 5K, to find the TSS related transitions at low temperatures.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The field of 2D materials-based nanophotonics has been growing at a rapid pace, triggered by the ability to design nanophotonic systems with in situ control, unprecedented degrees of freedom, and to build material heterostructures from bottom up with atomic precision. A wide palette of polaritonic classes have been identified, comprising ultra confined optical fields, even approaching characteristic length scales of a single atom. These advances have been a real boost for the emerging field of quantum nanophotonics, where the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and-or polaritons and their interactions become relevant. Examples include, quantum nonlocal effects, ultrastrong light matter interactions, Cherenkov radiation, access to forbidden transitions, hydrodynamic effects, single plasmon nonlinearities, polaritonic quantization, topological effects etc. In addition to these intrinsic quantum nanophotonic phenomena, the 2D material system can also be used as a sensitive probe for the quantum properties of the material that carries the nanophotonics modes, or quantum materials in its vicinity. Here, polaritons act as a probe for otherwise invisible excitations, e.g. in superconductors, or as a new tool to monitor the existence of Berry curvature in topological materials and superlattice effects in twisted 2D materials.</div>

<div class="abstract">Manipulating electronic interlayer coupling in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials is essential for designing opto-electronic devices. Here, we control vibrational and electronic interlayer coupling in bi- and trilayer 2H-MoS$_2$ using large external electric fields in a micro-capacitor device. The electric field lifts Raman selection rules and activates phonon modes in excellent agreement with ab-initio calculations. Through polarization resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in the same device, we observe a strongly tunable valley dichroism with maximum circular polarization degree of $\sim 60\%$ in bilayer and $\sim 35\%$ in trilayer MoS$_2$ that are fully consistent with a rate equation model which includes input from electronic band structure calculations. We identify the highly delocalized electron wave function between the layers close to the high symmetry $Q$ points as the origin of the tunable circular dichroism. Our results demonstrate the possibility of electric field tunable interlayer coupling for controlling emergent spin-valley physics and hybridization driven effects in vdW materials and their heterostructures.</div>

We study the moir\'e bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, focusing on WSe$_2$, at small twist angles using a combination of first principles density functional theory, continuum modeling, and Hartree-Fock approximation. We reveal the rich physics at small twist angles $\theta<4^\circ$, and identify a particular magic angle at which the top valence moir\'e band achieves almost perfect flatness. In the vicinity of this magic angle, we predict the realization of a generalized Kane-Mele model with a topological flat band, interaction-driven Haldane insulator, and Mott insulators at the filling of one hole per moir\'e unit cell. The combination of flat dispersion and uniformity of Berry curvature near the magic angle holds promise for realizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect at fractional filling.

<div class="abstract">In this paper, we present a Kane-Mele model in the presence of magnetic field and next nearest neighbors hopping amplitudes for investigations the electronic and optical properties of monolayer Germanene. Specially, we address the dynamical conductivity of the structure as a function of photon frequency and in the presence of magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling at finite temperature. Using linear response theory and Green's function approach, the frequency dependence of optical conductivity has been obtained in the context of Kane-Mele model Hamiltonian. Our results show a finite Drude response at low frequency at non zero value for magnetic field in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. However Drude weight gets remarkable amount in the presence of electron doping. The thermal conductivity and specific heat increase with increasing the temperature at low amounts of temperature due to the increasing of thermal energy of charge carriers and excitation of them to the conduction bands. The results for Seebeck coefficient show the sign of thermopower is negative in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Also we have studied the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity of Germanene monolayer due to both spin orbit coupling and magnetic field factors in details.</div>

<div class="abstract">Electron spins in Si are an attractive platform for quantum computation, backed with their scalability and fast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates. Despite the importance of two-dimensional integration with efficient connectivity between qubits for medium- to large-scale quantum computation, however, a practical device design that guarantees qubit addressability is yet to be seen. Here, we propose a practical 3 x 3 quantum dot device design and a larger-scale design as a longer-term target. The design goal is to realize qubit connectivity to the four nearest neighbors while ensuring addressability. We show that a 3 x 3 quantum dot array can execute four-qubit Grover's algorithm more efficiently than the one-dimensional counterpart. To scale up the two-dimensional array beyond 3 x 3, we propose a novel structure with ferromagnetic gate electrodes. Our results showcase the possibility of medium-sized quantum processors in Si with fast quantum logic gates and long coherence times.</div>

<div class="abstract">Electrons exposed to a two-dimensional (2D) periodic potential and a uniform, perpendicular magnetic field exhibit a fractal, self-similiar energy spectrum known as the Hofstadter butterfly. Recently, related high-temperature quantum oscillations (Brown-Zak oscillations) were discovered in graphene moir\'{e} systems, whose origin lie in the repetitive occurrence of extended minibands/magnetic Bloch states at rational fractions of magnetic flux per unit cell giving rise to an increase in band conductivity. In this work, we report on the experimental observation of band conductivity oscillations in an electrostatically defined and gate-tunable graphene superlattice, which are governed both by the internal structure of the Hofstadter butterfly (Brown-Zak oscillations) and by a commensurability relation between the cyclotron radius of electrons and the superlattice period (Weiss oscillations). We obtain a complete, unified description of band conductivity oscillations in two-dimensional superlattices, yielding a detailed match between theory and experiment.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene has emerged as a powerful platform for studying strongly correlated electron physics, owing to its almost dispersionless low-energy bands and the ability to tune the band filling by electrostatic gating. Techniques to control the twist angle between graphene layers have led to rapid experimental progress but improving sample quality is essential for separating the delicate correlated-electron physics from disorder effects. Owing to the 2D nature of the system and the relatively low carrier density, the samples are highly susceptible to small doping inhomogeneity which can drastically modify the local potential landscape. This potential disorder is distinct from the twist-angle variation which has been studied elsewhere. Here, by using low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy and planar tunneling junction measurements, we demonstrate that flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene can amplify small doping inhomogeneity that surprisingly leads to carrier confinement, which in graphene could previously only be realized in the presence of a strong magnetic field.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>X. Chen, W. Zheng</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We propose that the non-linear Hall response with the preserved time-reversal symmetry can be observed in the Bloch oscillation of the ultracold atoms in optical lattices. In the short-time limit of Bloch oscillations with a DC driving field, the non-linear Hall current dominates with time reversal symmetry and is a second-order response of the external field strength. The associated Berry curvature dipole, which is the second order nonlinear coefficient of the driving field, can be extracted from the dynamics. In the presence of an AC driving field, the nonlinear Hall response will double the driving frequency in the case of time reversal symmetry.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The dipole blockade phenomenon is a direct consequence of strong dipole-dipole interaction, where only single atom can be excited because the doubly excited state is shifted out of resonance. The corresponding two-body entanglement with non-zero concurrence induced by the dipole blockade effect is an important resource for quantum information processing. Here, we propose a novel physical mechanism for realizing dipole blockade without the dipole-dipole interaction, where two qubits coupled to a cavity, are driven by a coherent field. By suitably chosen placements of the qubits in the cavity and by adjusting the relative decay strengths of the qubits and cavity field, we kill many unwanted excitation pathways. This leads to dipole blockade. In addition, we show that these two qubits are strongly entangled over a broad regime of the system parameters. We show that a strong signature of this dipole blockade is the bunching property of the cavity photons which thus provides a possible measurement of the dipole blockade. We present dynamical features of the dipole blockade without dipole-dipole interaction. The proposal presented in this work can be realized not only in traditional cavity QED, but also in non-cavity topological photonics involving edge modes.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The Berry phase understanding of electronic properties has attracted special interest in condensed matter physics, leading to phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect and the topological Hall effect. A non-vanishing Berry phase, induced in momentum space by the band structure or in real space by a non-coplanar spin structure, is the origin of both effects. Here, we report a sign conversion of the anomalous Hall effect and a large topological Hall effect in (Cr0.9B0.1)Te single crystals. The spin reorientation from an easy-axis structure at high temperature to an easy-cone structure below 140 K leads to conversion of the Berry curvature, which influences both, anomalous and topological, Hall effects in the presence of an applied magnetic field and current. We compare and summarize the topological Hall effect in four categories with different mechanisms and have a discussion into the possible artificial fake effect of topological Hall effect in polycrystalline samples, which provides a deep understanding of the relation between spin structure and Hall properties.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>A. Graf, F. Piechon</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Being dispersionless, flat bands on periodic lattices are solely characterized by their macroscopically degenerate eigenstates: compact localized states (CLSs) in real space and Bloch states in reciprocal space. Based on this property, this work presents a straightforward method to build flat-band tight-binding models with short-range hoppings \emph{on any periodic lattice}. The method consists in starting from a CLS and engineering families of Bloch Hamiltonians as quadratic (or linear) functions of the associated Bloch state. The resulting tight-binding models not only exhibit a flat band, but also multifold quadratic (or linear) band touching points (BTPs) whose number, location, and degeneracy can be controlled to a large extent. Quadratic flat-band models are ubiquitous: they can be built from any arbitrary CLS, on any lattice, in any dimension and with any number $N\geq2$ of bands. Linear flat-band models are rarer: they require $N\geq3$ and can only be built from CLSs that fulfill certain compatibility relations with the underlying lattice. Most flat-band models from the literature can be classified according to this scheme: Mielke's and Tasaki's models belong to the quadratic class, while the Lieb, dice and breathing Kagome models belong to the linear class. Many novel flat-band models are introduced, among which an $N=4$ bilayer honeycomb model with fourfold quadratic BTPs, an $N=5$ dice model with fivefold linear BTPs, and an $N=3$ Kagome model with BTPs that can be smoothly tuned from linear to quadratic.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>Y. Sheffer, A. Stern</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We show that the flat bands in the chiral model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene remain exactly flat in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. This is shown by an exact mapping between the model and the lowest Landau level wavefunctions at an effective magnetic field, in which the external field is either augmented or reduced by one flux quantum per unit cell. When the external field reaches one flux quantum per unit cell, the model exhibits a topological phase transition. These findings allow us to analyze a Jain-series of Fractional Chern Insulators states in the exactly flat band, and to point out an unconventional dependence of the energy gap on the magnetic field.</div>

<div class="abstract">Floquet engineering offers a path to optically-controlled materials, but experimental implementations have frequently relied on femtosecond pulses to achieve the high peak fields required to maximise interactions and obtain a measurable response. The Floquet formalism, however, is based on a continuous, periodic drive. Here we use femtosecond laser pulses to drive the optical Stark effect, a simple realization of Floquet engineering, in monolayer WS2. By monitoring the coherent evolution of the free-induction decay, we show that the system evolves adiabatically, and that the finite duration of the pulses does not introduce any effects beyond Floquet theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the induced energy shift follows a linear dependence on instantaneous intensity, even for ultrafast driving fields of fewer than 15 optical cycles.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Implementing two-qubit gates via strong coupling between quantum-dot qubits and a superconducting microwave cavity requires achieving coupling rates that are much faster than decoherence rates. Typically, this involves tuning the qubit either to a sweet spot, where it is relatively insensitive to charge noise, or to a point where it is resonant with the microwave cavity. Unfortunately, such operating points seldom coincide. Here, we theoretically investigate several schemes for performing gates between two quantum-dot hybrid qubits, mediated by a microwave cavity. The rich physics of the quantum dot hybrid qubit gives rise to two types of sweet spots, which can occur at operating points with strong charge dipole moments. Such strong interactions provide new opportunities for off-resonant gating, thereby removing one of the main obstacles for long-distance two-qubit gates. Our results suggest that the numerous tuning knobs of quantum dot hybrid qubits make them good candidates for strong coupling. In particular, we show that off-resonant red-sideband-mediated two-qubit gates can exhibit fidelities $>$95\% for realistic operating parameters, and we describe improvements that could potentially yield gate fidelities $>$99\%.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We report on the experimental demonstration of atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-graphene van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure nanoelectromechanical resonators with ultrawide frequency tuning. With direct electrostatic gate tuning, these vdW resonators exhibit exceptional tunability, in general, {\Delta}f/f0 >200%, for continuously tuning the same device and the same mode (e.g., from ~23 to ~107MHz), up to {\Delta}f/f0 = 370%, the largest fractional tuning range in such resonators to date. This remarkable electromechanical resonance tuning is investigated by two different analytical models and finite element simulations. Further, we carefully perform clear control experiments and simulations to elucidate the difference in frequency tuning between heterostructure and single-material resonators. At a given initial strain level, the tuning range depends on the two-dimensional (2D) Young's moduli of the constitutive crystals; devices built on materials with lower 2D moduli show wider tuning ranges. This study exemplifies that vdW heterostructure resonators can retain unconventionally broad, continuous tuning, which is promising for voltage-controlled, tunable nanosystems.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>Z. Run-Sen, J. Jin-Wu</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Van der Waals heterostructures are constructed by stacking different atomic layers and can inherit many novel electronic and optical properties from the constituting atomic layers. Mechanical stability is of key importance for the high performance of nano devices based on the van der Waals heterostructure. In particular, buckling instability is a critical mechanical issue for the heterostructure due to its two-dimensional nature. Using graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure as an example, the present work demonstrates the relationship between the buckling instability and the inevitable misfit strain in the heterostructure by molecular dynamics simulations. The misfit strain has rather different effects on the buckling phenomenon depending on the magnitude of the misfit strain.   (1) For negative misfit strain, the buckling stability of the heterostructure is reduced by the misfit strain. It is because the graphene layer, which initiates the buckling process in the heterostructure of negative misfit strain, is pre-compressed by the misfit strain that accelerates the buckling of the graphene layer.   (2) For small positive misfit strain, the buckling stability for the graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is elevated. The underlying mechanism is that the graphene layer initiates the buckling process of the heterostructure and is pre-stretched by the small positive misfit strain, which decelerates the buckling of the graphene layer.   (3) For large positive misfit strain, the graphene layer is pre-stretched while the MoS$_2$ layer is considerably pre-compressed, so the buckling of the heterostructure is initiated by the MoS$_2$ layer. As a consequence, the buckling stability of the graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is reduced by the increase of large positive misfit strain. These findings shall be valuable for understanding mechanical properties of van der Waals heterostructures.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We have measured Coulomb drag between an individual single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) as a one-dimensional (1D) conductor and the two-dimensional (2D) conductor monolayer graphene, separated by a few-atom-thick boron nitride layer. The graphene carrier density is tuned across the charge neutrality point (CNP) by a gate, while the SWNT remains degenerate. At high temperatures, the drag resistance changes sign across the CNP, as expected for momentum transfer from drive to drag layer, and exhibits layer exchange Onsager reciprocity. We find that layer reciprocity is broken near the graphene CNP at low temperatures due to nonlinear drag response associated with temperature dependent drag and thermoelectric effects. The drag resistance shows power-law dependences on temperature and carrier density characteristic of 1D-2D Fermi liquid/Dirac fluid drag. The 2D drag signal at high temperatures decays with distance from the 1D source slower than expected for a diffusive current distribution, suggesting additional interaction effects in the graphene in the hydrodynamic transport regime.</div>

<div class="abstract">Artificial atoms realized by superconducting circuits offer unique opportunities to store and process quantum information with high fidelity. Among them, implementations of circuits that harness intrinsic noise protection have been rapidly developed in recent years. These noise-protected devices constitute a new class of qubits in which the computational states are largely decoupled from local noise channels. The main challenges in engineering such systems are simultaneously guarding against both bit- and phase-flip errors, and also ensuring high-fidelity qubit control. Although partial noise protection is possible in superconducting circuits relying on a single quantum degree of freedom, the promise of complete protection can only be fulfilled by implementing multimode or hybrid circuits. This Perspective reviews the theoretical principles at the heart of these new qubits, describes recent experiments, and highlights the potential of robust encoding of quantum information in superconducting qubits.</div>

To this end, we use Floquet theory to study a system subjected to a two-frequency drive. We derive an effective Hamiltonian with high frequency expansions, for which the electric polarization is computed with the Berry phase formula.

<div class="abstract">A recent experiment [Nature 579, 210--213 (2020)] probed the extent of the Kondo cloud in 1D by measuring the effect of electrostatic perturbations applied a distance $L$ away from the impurity on $T_K$. We study the Kondo cloud in a model proposed to describe this experimental setup, consisting of a single impurity Anderson model coupled to two semi-infinite 1D leads. In agreement with the experimental results, we find that $T_K$ is strongly affected by perturbations to the lead within the Kondo cloud. We obtain a complementary picture of the Kondo cloud in this system by observing how the Kondo state manifests itself in the local density of states of the leads, which may be observed experimentally via scanning tunneling microscopy. Our results support the existing experimental data and provide detailed predictions for future experiments seeking to characterize the Kondo cloud in this system.</div>
