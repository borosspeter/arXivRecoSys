<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In Weyl semimetals the location of linear band crossings, the Weyl cones, is not bound to any high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone, unlike the Dirac nodes in graphene. This flexibility is advantageous for valleytronics, where information is encoded in the valleys of the band structure when intervalley scattering is weak. However, if numerous Weyl cones coexist the encoded information can decohere rapidly because of band mixing. Here, we investigate how the helical iso-spin texture of Weyl cones affects valleytronics in heterojunctions of Weyl materials, and show how the chirality of this iso-spin texture can serve to encode information.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We study the effects caused by Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling over the thermoelectric transport properties of a single-electron transistor, viz., a quantum dot connected to one-dimensional leads. Using linear response theory and employing the numerical renormalization group method, we calculate the thermopower, electrical and thermal conductances, dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, and study the Wiedemann-Franz law, showing their temperature maps. Our results for all those properties indicate that spin-orbit coupling drives the system into the Kondo regime. We show that the thermoelectric transport properties, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, obey the expected universality of the Kondo strong coupling fixed point. In addition, our results show a notable increase in the thermoelectric figure of merit, caused by the spin-orbit coupling in the one-dimensional quantum dot leads.</div>

<div class="abstract">Quantum dots are recognized as a suitable platform for studying thermodynamic phenomena involving single electronic charges and spins in nano-scale devices. However, such a thermodynamic system is usually driven by electron reservoirs at different temperatures, not by a lattice temperature gradient. We report on experimental observations of charge-spin cooperative dynamics in transitions of two-electron spin states in a GaAs double quantum dot located in a non-equilibrium phonon environment. Enhancements in the spin-flip processes are observed, originating from phonon excitation combined with the spin-orbit interaction. In addition, due to the spatial gradient of phonon density between the dots, the spin-flip rate during an inter-dot electron tunnel from a hot to a cold dot is more enhanced than in the other direction, resulting in accumulation of parallel spin states in the double dot.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) provides an example of a system in which the interplay of interlayer interactions and superlattice structure impacts electron transport in a variety of non-trivial ways and gives rise to a plethora of interesting effects. Understanding the mechanisms of electron scattering in TBG has, however, proven challenging, raising many questions about the origins of resistivity in this system. Here we show that TBG exhibits high-temperature magnetooscillations originating from the scattering of charge carriers between TBG minivalleys. The amplitude of these oscillations reveals that interminivalley scattering is strong, and its characteristic time scale is comparable to that of its intraminivalley counterpart. Furthermore, by exploring the temperature dependence of these oscillations, we estimate the electron-electron collision rate in TBG and find that it exceeds that of monolayer graphene. Our study demonstrates the consequences of the relatively small size of the superlattice Brillouin zone and Fermi velocity reduction on lateral transport in TBG.</div>

<div class="title"><b>Title:</b> Spin-Valley Qubit Dynamics In Exchange Coupled Silicon Quantum Dots</div>
<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>D. Buterakos, S. D. Sarma</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The presence of valley states is a significant obstacle to realizing quantum information technologies in Silicon quantum dots, as leakage into alternate valley states can introduce errors into the computation. We use a perturbative analytical approach to study the dynamics of exchange-coupled quantum dots with valley degrees of freedom. We show that if the valley splitting is large and electrons are not properly initialized to valley eigenstates, then time evolution of the system will lead to spin-valley entanglement. Spin-valley entanglement will also occur if the valley splitting is small and electrons are not initialized to the same valley state. Additionally, we show that for small valley splitting, spin-valley entanglement does not affect measurement probabilities of two-qubit systems; however, systems with more qubits will be affected. This means that two-qubit gate fidelities measured in two-qubit systems may miss the effects of valley degrees of freedom. Our work shows how the existence of valleys may adversely affect multiqubit fidelities even when the system temperature is very low.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Little-Parks oscillations of a hollow superconducting cylinder are of interest for flux-driven topological superconductivity in single Rashba nanowires. The oscillations are typically symmetric in the orientation of the applied magnetic flux. Using double InAs nanowires coated by an epitaxial superconducting Al shell which, despite the non-centro-symmetric geometry, behaves effectively as one hollow cylinder, we demonstrate that a small misalignment of the applied parallel field with respect to the axis of the nanowires can produce field-asymmetric Little-Parks oscillations. These are revealed by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the misaligned parallel field direction. The asymmetry occurs in both the destructive regime, in which superconductivity is destroyed for half-integer quanta of flux through the shell, and in the non-destructive regime, where superconductivity is depressed but not fully destroyed at these flux values.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Magnetic impurities in $s$-wave superconductors lead to spin-polarized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) in-gap states. Chains of magnetic impurities offer one of the most viable routes for the realization of Majorana bound states which hold a promise for topological quantum computing. However, this ambitious goal looks distant since no quantum coherent degrees of freedom have yet been identified in these systems. To fill this gap we propose an effective two-level system, a YSR qubit, stemming from two nearby impurities. Using a time-dependent wave-function approach, we derive an effective Hamiltonian describing the YSR qubit evolution as a function of distance between the impurity spins, their relative orientations, and their dynamics. We show that the YSR qubit can be controlled and read out using the state-of-the-art experimental techniques for manipulation of the spins. Finally, we address the effect of the spin noises on the coherence properties of the YSR qubit, and show a robust behaviour for a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters. Looking forward, the YSR qubit could facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates in hybrid systems where they are coupled to topological Majorana qubits.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>M. Mirzakhani, F. M. Peeters</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Using the continuum model, we investigate the electronic properties of two types of bilayer graphene ring (BLGR) geometries: (i) an isolated BLGR and (ii) a monolayer graphene (MLG) ring put on top of an infinite graphene sheet. Solving the Dirac-Weyl equation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and applying infinite-mass boundary condition at the ring boundaries, we obtain analytical results for the energy levels and corresponding wave spinors for both structures. Our results show that the presence of interface boundary in a hybrid BLGR modifies drastically the energy levels as compared to that of an isolated BLGR. The intervalley symmetry $ E^K_e (m) = -E^{K'}_h(m) $ between the electron (e) and hole (h) states ($ m $ being the angular momentum quantum number) is found for the energy spectrum of an isolated BLGR, while it is broken for the hybrid BLGR. Our analytical results agree with those obtained within the tight-binding model (TBM). Sizeable and magnetically tunable band gap, in contrast to that in the zero-width BLGR model, is predicted for both ring structures, which experimentally can be measured in, e.g., magnetotransport measurements.</div>

<div class="abstract">Based on the similarity between the chiral nanotube and the classical solenoid, we study chiral transport along the circumferential direction in a carbon nanotube. We calculate the chiral conductivity, representing a circumferential current induced by an electric field along the nanotube axis for various chiralities of carbon nanotubes. We find that the chiral conductivity in a chiral nanotube is in general non zero, and oscillates as a function of the Fermi energy. This oscillating behavior is attributed to the subband structure of the nanotubes and the warping of the Fermi surfaces.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>B. Mera, A. Zhang, N. Goldman</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum geometry has emerged as a central and ubiquitous concept in quantum sciences, with direct consequences on quantum metrology and many-body quantum physics. In this context, two fundamental geometric quantities play complementary roles: the Fubini-Study metric, which introduces a notion of distance between quantum states defined over a parameter space, and the Berry curvature associated with Berry-phase effects and topological band structures. In fact, recent studies have revealed direct relations between these two important quantities, suggesting that topological properties can, in special cases, be deduced from the quantum metric. In this work, we establish general and exact relations between the quantum metric and the topological invariants of generic Dirac Hamiltonians. In particular, we demonstrate that topological indices (Chern numbers or winding numbers) are bounded by the quantum volume determined by the quantum metric. Our theoretical framework, which builds on the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, is applicable to topological insulators and semimetals of arbitrary spatial dimensions, with or without chiral symmetry. This work clarifies the role of the Fubini-Study metric in topological states of matter, suggesting unexplored topological responses and metrological applications in a broad class of quantum-engineered systems.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Single-charge pumps are the main candidates for quantum-based standards of the unit ampere because they can generate accurate and quantized electric currents. In order to approach the metrological requirements in terms of both accuracy and speed of operation, in the past decade there has been a focus on semiconductor-based devices. The use of a variety of semiconductor materials enables the universality of charge pump devices to be tested, a highly desirable demonstration for metrology, with GaAs and Si pumps at the forefront of these tests. Here, we show that pumping can be achieved in a yet unexplored semiconductor, i.e. germanium. We realise a single-hole pump with a tunable-barrier quantum dot electrostatically defined at a Ge/SiGe heterostructure interface. We observe quantized current plateaux by driving the system with a single sinusoidal drive up to a frequency of 100 MHz. The operation of the prototype was affected by accidental formation of multiple dots, probably due to disorder potential, and random charge fluctuations. We suggest straightforward refinements of the fabrication process to improve pump characteristics in future experiments.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We analyze the conductance of a one-dimensional topological superconductor periodically driven to host Floquet Majorana zero-modes for different configurations of coupling to external leads. We compare the conductance of constantly coupled leads, as in standard transport experiments, with the stroboscopic conductance of pulsed coupling to leads used to identify a scattering matrix topological index for periodically driven systems. We find that the sum of DC conductance at voltages multiples of the driving frequency is quantitatively close to the stroboscopic conductance at all voltage biases. This is consistent with previous work which indicated that the summed conductance at zero/pi resonance is quantized. We quantify the difference between the two in terms of the width of their respective resonances and analyze that difference for two different stroboscopic driving protocols of the Kitaev chain. While the quantitative differences are protocol-dependent, we find that generically the discrepancy is larger when the zero mode weight at the end of the chain depends strongly on the offset time between the driving cycle and the pulsed coupling period.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The helical edge states of time-reversal invariant two-dimensional topological insulators are protected against backscattering in idealized models. In more realistic scenarios with a shallow confining potential at the sample boundary, additional strongly interacting edge states may arise, that could interfere with the topological protection of edge conduction. We find that interaction effects within the reconstructed edges are well described by the Luttinger liquid model. While interactions between this Luttinger liquid and the helical edge states can in principle give rise to dynamical spin polarization and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that random spin-orbit coupling strongly suppresses such dynamical spin polarization, resulting in the persistence of quantized edge conduction.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Superconducting qubits are a leading candidate for quantum computing but display temporal fluctuations in their energy relaxation times T1. This introduces instabilities in multi-qubit device performance. Furthermore, autocorrelation in these time fluctuations introduces challenges for obtaining representative measures of T1 for process optimization and device screening. These T1 fluctuations are often attributed to time varying coupling of the qubit to defects, putative two level systems (TLSs). In this work, we develop a technique to probe the spectral and temporal dynamics of T1 in single junction transmons by repeated T1 measurements in the frequency vicinity of the bare qubit transition, via the AC-Stark effect. Across 10 qubits, we observe strong correlations between the mean T1 averaged over approximately nine months and a snapshot of an equally weighted T1 average over the Stark shifted frequency range. These observations are suggestive of an ergodic-like spectral diffusion of TLSs dominating T1, and offer a promising path to more rapid T1 characterization for device screening and process optimization.</div>
