<div class="abstract">Topological edge states exhibit dissipationless transport and electrically-driven topological phase transitions, making them ideal for next-generation transistors that are not constrained by Moore's law. Nevertheless, their dispersion has never been probed and is often assumed to be simply linear, without any rigorous justification. Here we determine the non-linear electrical response of topological edge states in the ballistic regime and demonstrate the way this response ascertains the presence of symmetry breaking terms in the edge dispersion, such as deviations from non-linearity and tilted spin quantization axes. The non-linear response stems from discontinuities in the band occupation on either side of a Zeeman gap, and its direction is set by the spin orientation with respect to the Zeeman field. We determine the edge dispersion for several classes of topological materials and discuss experimental measurement.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Recent formal classifications of crystalline topological insulators predict that the combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetry gives rise to topological invariants beyond the ones known for other lattice symmetries. Although the classification proves their existence, it does not indicate a way of calculating the values of those invariants. Here, we show that a specific set of concentric Wilson loops and line invariants yields the values of all topological invariants in two-dimensional systems with pure rotation symmetry in class AII. Examples of this analysis are given for specific models with two-fold and three-fold rotational symmetry. We find new invariants that correspond to the presence of higher-order topology and corner charges.</div>

<div class="abstract">The Hall effect, in which current flows perpendicular to an applied electrical bias, has played a prominent role in modern condensed matter physics over much of the subject's history. Appearing variously in classical, relativistic and quantum guises, it has among other roles contributed to establishing the band theory of solids, to research on new phases of strongly interacting electrons, and to the phenomenology of topological condensed matter. The dissipationless Hall current requires time-reversal symmetry breaking. For over a century it has either been ascribed to externally applied magnetic field and referred to as the ordinary Hall effect, or ascribed to spontaneous non-zero total internal magnetization (ferromagnetism) and referred to as the anomalous Hall effect. It has not commonly been associated with antiferromagnetic order. More recently, however, theoretical predictions and experimental observations have identified large Hall effects in some compensated magnetic crystals, governed by neither of the global magnetic-dipole symmetry breaking mechanisms mentioned above. The goals of this article are to systematically organize the present understanding of anomalous antiferromagnetic materials that generate a non-zero Hall effect, which we will call anomalous Hall antiferromagnets, and to discuss this class of materials in a broader fundamental and applied research context. Our motivation in drawing attention to anomalous Hall antiferromagnets is two-fold. First, since Hall effects that are not governed by magnetic dipole symmetry breaking are at odds with the traditional understanding of the phenomenon, the topic deserves attention on its own. Second, this new reincarnation has again placed the Hall effect in the middle of an emerging field of physics at the intersection of multipole magnetism, topological condensed matter, and spintronics.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>S. Bose, H. Jeong</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In this paper, we compare single-photon qubits and hybrid qubits as information carriers through quantum teleportation using a Gaussian continuous-variable channel. A hybrid qubit in our study is in the form of entanglement between a coherent state and a single photon. We find that hybrid qubits outperform photonic qubits when coherent amplitudes of the hybrid qubits are as low as $\alpha\lesssim 1$, while photonic qubits yield better results for larger amplitudes. We analyze effects of photon losses, and observe that the overall character of teleportation for different qubits remains the same although the teleportation fidelities are degraded by photon losses. Our work provides a comparative look at practical quantum information processing with different types of qubits.</div>

<div class="abstract">The rapid development of reliable Quantum Processing Units (QPU) opens up novel computational opportunities for machine learning. Here, we introduce a procedure for measuring the similarity between graph-structured data, based on the time-evolution of a quantum system. By encoding the topology of the input graph in the Hamiltonian of the system, the evolution produces measurement samples that retain key features of the data. We study analytically the procedure and illustrate its versatility in providing links to standard classical approaches. We then show numerically that this scheme performs well compared to standard graph kernels on typical benchmark datasets. Finally, we study the possibility of a concrete implementation on a realistic neutral-atom quantum processor.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>T. Funato, M. Matsuo</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We theoretically study the mechanical induction of the spin density via the Rashba spin--orbit interaction (SOI). The spin density in the linear response to lattice distortion dynamics is calculated based on the microscopic theory. We reveal that there are two mechanisms of spin induction: one is the acoustic Edelstein effect (AEE) from the acceleration of the lattice dynamics and the other is caused by the Rashba spin--vorticity coupling (RSVC). We find that the AEE induces a more efficient spin-to-charge conversion in comparison with the conventional electric Edelstein effect. The induced spin density due to the RSVC is expressed as a Berry curvature-like quantity; therefore, it can be attributed to the spatial symmetry breaking due to the Rashba SOI. Our work demonstrates high-efficiency spin generation in Rashba systems.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>C. Rouze, D. S. Franca</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Estimating physical properties of quantum states from measurements is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum science. In this work, we identify conditions on states under which it is possible to infer the expectation value of all quasi-local observables of a given locality up to a relative error from a number of samples that grows polylogarithmically with system size and polynomially on the locality of the target observables. This constitutes an exponential improvement over known tomography methods in some regimes. We achieve our results by combining one of the most well-established techniques to learn quantum states, the maximum entropy method, with techniques from the emerging fields of quantum optimal transport and classical shadows. We conjecture that our condition holds for all states exhibiting some form of decay of correlations and establish it for several subsets thereof. These include widely studied classes of states such as one-dimensional thermal and gapped ground states and high-temperature Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on arbitrary hypergraphs. Moreover, we show improvements of the maximum entropy method beyond the sample complexity of independent interest. These include identifying regimes in which it is possible to perform the postprocessing efficiently and novel bounds on the condition number of covariance matrices of many-body states.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum Information Theory promises to speed up computation so is observed in real quantum computers as proved to its classical counterpart. This revolutionizes every field linked directly or indirectly with computation. Grover algorithm in quantum information gives quadratic speed up in unstructured database search. With the availability of public online resources for quantum computers like IBM, quantum image processing came into the picture for making use of quantum computers in the image processing field. Our research interest is to find all darker pixels in a 2x2 grayscale image using Grover's algorithm. We studied it in two different ways. In the first method, I ran Grover's algorithm on the python generated classical image. In the second method, I converted a python-generated 2x2 image into a quantum image and then ran Grover's algorithm to locate the darker pixels. As has been observed in complexity analysis, Grover's unstructured search has the O(2^{n}) while as for classical schemes O(2^{2n+2m}), where m and n denote the dimensions of the image.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>K. Domino, A. Kundu, K. Krawiec</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The consequences of disruptions in railway traffic are the primary cause of passengers' dissatisfaction. Hence, appropriate dispatching decisions are necessary (e.g., by assigning the order of trains), given the numerous restrictions of traffic nature. The latter is perceived as an NP-hard problem. This paper outlines QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) and HOBO (higher-order binary optimization) representations for dispatching problems of railway traffic management. Specifically, we consider minimal span between trains, minimal stay on stations, station/track occupation, and rolling stock circulation. The main result is the hybrid algorithm to deal with disturbances in rail traffic on single-, double- and multi-track lines; the demonstrative model illustrates the issue briefly. This algorithm can solve railway dispatching problems using the quantum annealer or any other QUBO-based optimization device.</div>

<div class="abstract">The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has proved to be an effective classical-quantum algorithm serving multiple purposes, from solving combinatorial optimization problems to finding the ground state of many-body quantum systems. Since QAOA is an ansatz-dependent algorithm, there is always a need to design ansatz for better optimization. To this end, we propose a digitized version of QAOA enhanced via the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity. Specifically, we use a counterdiabatic (CD) driving term to design a better ansatz, along with the Hamiltonian and mixing terms, enhancing the global performance. We apply our digitized-counterdiabatic QAOA to Ising models, classical optimization problems, and the P-spin model, demonstrating that it outperforms standard QAOA in all cases we study.</div>

<div class="title"><b>Title:</b> Influence of coin symmetry on infinite hitting times in quantum walks</div>
<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>P. Prabhu, T. A. Brun</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Classical random walks on finite graphs have an underrated property: a walk from any vertex can reach every other vertex in finite time, provided they are connected. Discrete-time quantum walks on finite connected graphs however, can have infinite hitting times. This phenomenon is related to graph symmetry, as previously characterized by the group of direction-preserving graph automorphisms that trivially affect the coin Hilbert space. If a graph is symmetric enough (in a particular sense) then the associated quantum walk unitary will contain eigenvectors that do not overlap a set of target vertices, for any coin flip operator. These eigenvectors span the Infinite Hitting Time (IHT) subspace. Quantum states in the IHT subspace never reach the target vertices, leading to infinite hitting times. However, this is not the whole story: the graph of the 3D cube does not satisfy this symmetry constraint, yet quantum walks on this graph with certain symmetric coins can exhibit infinite hitting times. We study the effect of coin symmetry by analyzing the group of coin-permutation symmetries (CPS): graph automorphisms that act nontrivially on the coin Hilbert space but leave the coin operator invariant. Unitaries using highly symmetric coins with large CPS groups, such as the permutation-invariant Grover coin, are associated with higher probabilities of never arriving, as a result of their larger IHT subspaces.</div>

The interplay of SOC and Berry curvature allows for the excitation of generalized Silin modes in the spin and valley-staggered-spin channels via an AC electric field.

In our study we have combined measurements of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in CoSi with material-specific calculations of the electronic structure and Berry curvature, as well as a general analysis of the band topology of space group (SG) 198. The observation of two nearly dispersionless SdH frequency branches provides unambiguous evidence of four Fermi surface sheets at the R point that reflect the symmetry-enforced orthogonality of the underlying wave functions at the intersections with the NPs.

<div class="abstract">In the presence of certain symmetries, three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can harbor not only surface Fermi arcs, but also surface Dirac cones. Motivated by the experimental observation of rotation-symmetry-protected Dirac semimetal states in iron-based superconductors, we investigate the potential intrinsic topological phases in a $C_{4z}$-rotational invariant superconducting Dirac semimetal with $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing. When the normal state harbors only surface Fermi arcs on the side surfaces, we find that an interesting gapped superconducting state with a quartet of Majorana cones on each side surface can be realized, even though the first-order topology of its bulk is trivial. When the normal state simultaneously harbors surface Fermi arcs and surface Dirac cones, we find that a second-order time-reversal invariant topological superconductor with helical Majorana hinge states can be realized. The criteria for these two distinct topological phases have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of three characteristic surfaces in momentum space. By reducing the bulk material to a thin film normal to the axis of rotation symmetry, we further find that a two-dimensional first-order time-reversal invariant topological superconductor can be realized if the inversion symmetry is broken by applying a gate voltage. Our work reveals that diverse topological superconducting phases and types of Majorana modes can be realized in superconducting Dirac semimetals.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Model wave functions constructed from (1+1)D conformal field theory (CFT) have played a vital role in studying chiral topologically ordered systems. There usually exist multiple degenerate ground states when such states are placed on the torus. The common practice for dealing with this degeneracy within the CFT framework is to take a full correlator on the torus, which includes both holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors, and decompose it into several conformal blocks. In this paper, we propose a pure chiral approach for the torus wave function construction. By utilizing the operator formalism, the wave functions are written as chiral correlators of holormorphic fields restricted to each individual topological sector. This method is not only conceptually much simpler, but also automatically provides us the anyon eigenbasis of the degenerate ground states (also known as the "minimally entangled states"). As concrete examples, we construct the full set of degenerate ground states for SO($n$)$_1$ and SU($n$)$_1$ chiral spin liquids on the torus, the former of which provide a complete wave function realization of Kitaev's sixteenfold way of anyon theories. We further characterize their topological orders by analytically computing the associated modular $S$ and $T$ matrices.</div>

<div class="abstract">Verifying the correct functioning of quantum gates is a crucial step towards reliable quantum information processing, but it becomes an overwhelming challenge as the system size grows due to the dimensionality curse. Recent theoretical breakthroughs show that it is possible to verify various important quantum gates with the optimal sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon)$ using local operations only, where $\epsilon$ is the estimation precision. In this work, we propose a variant of quantum gate verification (QGV) which is robust to practical gate imperfections, and experimentally realize efficient QGV on a two-qubit controlled-not gate and a three-qubit Toffoli gate using only local state preparations and measurements. The experimental results show that, by using only 1600 and 2600 measurements on average, we can verify with 95% confidence level that the implemented controlled-not gate and Toffoli gate have fidelities at least 99% and 97%, respectively. Demonstrating the superior low sample complexity and experimental feasibility of QGV, our work promises a solution to the dimensionality curse in verifying large quantum devices in the quantum era.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>V. Galgano, F. Holweck</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In Quantum Information theory, graph states are quantum states defined by graphs. In this work we exhibit a correspondence between graph states and the variety of binary symmetric principal minors, in particular their corresponding orbits under the action of $SL(2,\mathbb F_2)^{\times n}\rtimes \frak S_n$. We start by approaching the topic more widely, that is by studying the orbits of stabilizer-state subgroups of the $n$-fold Pauli group under an action of $\cal C_n^{\text{loc}}\rtimes \frak S_n$, where $\cal C_n^{\text{loc}}$ is the $n$-fold local Clifford group: we derive this action from the natural action of $SL(2,\mathbb F_2)^{\times n}\rtimes \frak S_n$ on the variety $\cal Z_n\subset \mathbb P(\mathbb F_2^{2^n})$ of principal minors of binary symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. The crucial step in this correspondence is in translating the latter action into an action of the local symplectic group $Sp_{2n}^{\text{loc}}(\mathbb F_2)$ on the Lagrangian Grassmannian $LG_{\mathbb F_2}(n,2n)$. We conclude by studying how the action on the stabilizer-state groups induces onto the stabilizer states, and finally restricting to the case of graph states.</div>

<div class="title"><b>Title:</b> Gravitational Dephasing in Optical Lattice Clocks</div>
<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>A. Kawasaki</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Optical lattice clocks can now resolve the height difference below 1 cm by means of the gravitational redshift. Further improvement in the stability enables the clocks to resolve the height difference of subsystems within an atomic ensemble that is conventionally interrogated as a single coherent spin state, resulting in the dephasing of the coherent spin state. This effect is observable with a clock of the stability of $\sim 10^{-21}$ by introducing single layer resolved imaging system for three dimensional optical lattice, and limits the 1 s stability of the clock at $10^{-19}$ without proper compensations. This can be the first observation of the decoherence of a quantum state by a gravitational effect, and the suppression of other systematic shifts to observe this gravitational dephasing seems feasible.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>M. Richter, J. Graspeuntner, T. Schafer, N. Wentzell, M. Aichhorn</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We investigate the interplay of electronic correlations and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for a one-band and a two-band honeycomb lattice model. The main difference between the two models concerning SOC is that in the one-band case the SOC is a purely non-local term in the basis of the $p_z$ orbitals, whereas in the two-band case with $p_x$ and $p_y$ as basis functions it is purely local. In order to grasp the correlation effects on non-local spin-orbit coupling, we apply the TRILEX approach that allows to calculate non-local contributions to the self-energy approximatively. For the two-band case we apply dynamical mean-field theory. In agreement with previous studies, we find that for all parameter values in our study, the effect of correlations on the spin-orbit coupling strength is that the bare effective SOC parameter is increased. However, this increase is much weaker in the non-local than in the local SOC case. Concerning the TRILEX method, we introduce the necessary formulas for calculations with broken SU(2) symmetry.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>R. Gupta, S. Roy, T. Das, A. S. De</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Entangled states like two-mode squeezed vacuum states are known to give quantum advantage in the illumination protocol, a method to detect a weakly reflecting target submerged in a thermal background. We use non-Gaussian photon-added and subtracted states as probes for the single-shot quantum illumination both in the presence and absence of noise. Based on the difference between the Chernoff bounds obtained with the coherent state and the non-Gaussian state having equal signal strengths, whose positive values are referred to as a quantum advantage in illumination, we classify the performance of non-Gaussian states, when photons are added (subtracted) in (from) a single mode or in (from) both the modes. We highlight the hierarchy among Gaussian and non-Gaussian states obtained via this method, which is compatible with correlations per unit signal strength. Interestingly, such hierarchy is different when comparisons are made only using the Chernoff bounds. The entire analysis is performed in presence of different noisy apparatus like faulty twin-beam generator, imperfect photon addition or subtraction as well as with noisy non-Gaussian probe states.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>D. Sadhukhan, J. Dziarmaga</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Considering an example of the long-range Kitaev model, we are looking for a correlation length in a model with long range interactions whose correlation functions away from a critical point have power-law tails instead of the usual exponential decay. It turns out that quasiparticle spectrum depends on a distance from the critical point in a way that allows to identify the standard correlation length exponent, $\nu$. The exponent implicitly defines a correlation length $\xi$ that diverges when the critical point is approached. We show that the correlation length manifests itself also in the correlation function but not in its exponential tail because there is none. Instead $\xi$ is a distance that marks a crossover between two different algebraic decays with different exponents. At distances shorter than $\xi$ the correlator decays with the same power law as at the critical point while at distances longer than $\xi$ it decays faster, with a steeper power law. For this correlator it is possible to formulate the usual scaling hypothesis with $\xi$ playing the role of the scaling distance. The correlation length also leaves its mark on the subleading anomalous fermionic correlator but, interestingly, there is a regime of long range interactions where its short distance critical power-law decay is steeper than its long distance power law tail.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Cold atoms and ions exhibit unparalleled performance in frequency metrology epitomized in the atomic clock. More recently, such atomic systems have been used to implement programmable quantum computers and simulators with highest reported operational fidelities across platforms. Their strength in metrology and quantum information processing offers the opportunity to utilize tailored, programmable entanglement generation to approach the `optimal quantum sensor' compatible with quantum mechanics. Here we report quantum enhancement in metrology beyond squeezing through low-depth, variational quantum circuits searching for optimal input states and measurement operators in a trapped ion platform. We perform entanglement-enhanced Ramsey interferometry finding optimal parameters for variational quantum circuits using a Bayesian approach to stochastic phase estimation tailored to the sensor platform capabilities and finite dynamic range of the interferometer. We verify the performance by both directly using theory predictions of optimal parameters, and performing online quantum-classical feedback optimization to `self-calibrate' the variational parameters. In both cases we find that variational circuits outperform classical and direct spin squeezing strategies under realistic noise and imperfections. With 26 ions we achieve 2.02(8) dB of metrological gain over classical interferometers.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In this work, we theoretically study transverse magnetic focusing in a two-dimensional electron gas with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction when proximitized along its edge with a superconducting contact. The presence of superconducting correlations leads to the emergence of chiral Andreev edge states which -- within this weak magnetic field regime -- may be pictured as states following semiclassical skipping orbits with alternating electron-hole nature. The spin-orbit induced splitting of the Fermi surface causes these carriers to move along cyclotron orbits with different radii, allowing for their spatial spin separation. When Andreev reflection takes place at the superconducting lead, scattered carriers flip both their charge and spin, generating distinguishable features in the transport properties of the device. In particular, we report a notable enhancement of the separation between the spin-split focal points, which scales linearly with the number of Andreev scattering events at the anomalous terminal. We support our results by calculating conductance maps to arbitrary points in the sample that provide a complete image of the ballistic electron-hole cyclotron paths.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The nature of discrete-time quantum walk in the presence of multiple marked states has been studied by Nahimovs and Rivosh. They introduced an exceptional configuration of clustered marked states $i.e.,$ if the marked states are arranged in a $\sqrt{k} \times \sqrt{k}$ cluster within a $\sqrt{N} \times \sqrt{N}$ grid, where $k=n^{2}$ and $n$ an odd integer. They showed that finding a single marked state among the multiple ones using quantum walk with AKR (Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh) coin requires $\Omega(\sqrt{N} - \sqrt{k})$ time. Furthermore, Nahimov and Rivosh also showed that the Grover's coin can find the same configuration of marked state both faster and with higher probability compared to that with the AKR coin. In this article, we show that using lackadaisical quantum walk, a variant of a three-state discrete-time quantum walk on a line, the success probability of finding all the clustered marked states of this exceptional configuration is nearly 1 with smaller run-time. We also show that the weights of the self-loop suggested for multiple marked states in the state-of-the-art works are not optimal for this exceptional configuration of clustered mark states. We propose a range of weights of the self-loop from which only one can give the desired result for this configuration.</div>

Various examples of the topological pseudo entropies are examined in three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory with Wilson loop insertions. Partition functions with knotted Wilson loops are directly related to topological pseudo (R\'enyi) entropies. We also show that the pseudo entropy in a certain setup is equivalent to the interface entropy in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), and leverage the equivalence to calculate the pseudo entropies in particular examples. Furthermore, we define a pseudo entropy extension of the left-right entanglement entropy in two-dimensional boundary CFTs and derive a universal formula for a pair of arbitrary boundary states. As a byproduct, we find that the topological interface entropy for rational CFTs has a contribution identical to the topological entanglement entropy on a torus.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We construct new families of spin chain Hamiltonians that are local, integrable and translationally invariant. To do so, we make use of the Clifford group that arises in quantum information theory. We consider translation invariant Clifford group transformations that can be described by matrix product operators (MPOs). We classify the translation invariant Clifford group transformations that consist of a shift operator and an MPO of bond dimension two -- this includes transformations that preserve locality of all Hamiltonians; as well as those that lead to non-local images of particular operators but nevertheless preserve locality of certain Hamiltonians. We characterise the translation invariant Clifford group transformations that take single-site Pauli operators to local operators on at most five sites -- examples of Quantum Cellular Automata -- leading to a discrete family of Hamiltonians that are equivalent to the canonical XXZ model under such transformations. For spin chains solvable by algebraic Bethe Ansatz, we explain how conjugating by a matrix product operator affects the underlying integrable structure. This allows us to relate our results to the usual classifications of integrable Hamiltonians. We also treat the case of spin chains solvable by free fermions.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>M. Sasdelli, T. Chin</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum annealing is a promising paradigm for building practical quantum computers. Compared to other approaches, quantum annealing technology has been scaled up to a larger number of qubits. On the other hand, deep learning has been profoundly successful in pushing the boundaries of AI. It is thus natural to investigate potentially game changing technologies such as quantum annealers to augment the capabilities of deep learning. In this work, we explore binary neural networks, which are lightweight yet powerful models typically intended for resource constrained devices. Departing from current training regimes for binary networks that smooth/approximate the activation functions to make the network differentiable, we devise a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation for the training problem. While the problem is intractable, i.e., the cost to estimate the binary weights scales exponentially with network size, we show how the problem can be optimized directly on a quantum annealer, thereby opening up to the potential gains of quantum computing. We experimentally validated our formulation via simulation and testing on an actual quantum annealer (D-Wave Advantage), the latter to the extent allowable by the capacity of current technology.</div>

Currently, continuous variable quantum computing is a rapidly developing field both theoretically and experimentally.

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The use of the nuclear spins surrounding electron spin qubits as quantum registers and long-lived memories opens the way to new applications in quantum information and biological sensing. Hence, there is a need for generic and robust forms of control of the nuclear registers. Although adiabatic gates are widely used in quantum information, they can become too slow to outpace decoherence. Here, we introduce a technique whereby adiabatic gates arise from the dynamical decoupling protocols that simultaneously extend coherence. We illustrate this pulse-based adiabatic control for nuclear spins around NV centers in diamond. We obtain a closed-form expression from Landau-Zener theory and show that it reliably describes the dynamics. By identifying robust Floquet states, we show that the technique enables polarisation, one-shot flips and state storage for nuclear spins. These results introduce a new control paradigm that combines dynamical decoupling with adiabatic evolution.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In this work, we show a correspondence between linear support vector machines (SVMs) and entanglement witnesses, and use this correspondence to generate entanglement witnesses for bipartite and tripartite qubit (and qudit) target entangled states. An SVM allows for the construction of a hyperplane that clearly delineates between separable states and the target entangled state; this hyperplane is a weighted sum of observables (`features') whose coefficients are optimized during the training of the SVM. In contrast to other methods such as deep neural networks, the training of an SVM is a convex optimization problem and always yields an `optimal' solution. We demonstrate with this method the ability to obtain witnesses that require only local measurements even when the target state is a non-stabilizer state. Furthermore, we show that SVMs are flexible enough to allow us to rank features, and to reduce the number of features systematically while bounding the inference error. This programmatic approach will allow us to streamline the detection of entangled states in experiment.</div>

<div class="abstract">Starting from the idea of Quantum Computing which is a concept that dates back to 80s, we come to the present day where we can perform calculations on real quantum computers. This sudden development of technology opens up new scenarios that quickly lead to the desire and the real possibility of integrating this technology into current software architectures. The usage of frameworks that allow computation to be performed directly on quantum hardware poses a series of challenges. This document describes a an architectural framework that addresses the problems of integrating an API exposed Quantum provider in an existing Enterprise architecture and it provides a minimum viable product (MVP) solution that really merges classical quantum computers on a basic scenario with reusable code on GitHub repository. The solution leverages a web-based frontend where user can build and select applications/use cases and simply execute it without any further complication. Every triggered run leverages on multiple backend options, that include a scheduler managing the queuing mechanism to correctly schedule jobs and final results retrieval.

<div class="abstract">The study of quantum finite automata (QFA's) is one of the possible approaches in exploring quantum computers with finite memory. Despite being one of the most restricted models, Moore-Crutchfield quantum finite automaton (MCQFA) is proven to be exponentially more succinct than classical finite automata models in recognizing certain languages such as $\mathtt{MOD}_{\rm p} = \{a^{j}~ |~ j \equiv 0 \mod p\}$, where $p$ is a prime number. In this paper, we present a modified MCQFA algorithm for the language $\mathtt{MOD}_{\rm p}$, the operators of which are selected based on the basis gates on the available real quantum computers. As a consequence, we obtain shorter quantum programs using less basis gates compared to the implementation of the original algorithm given in the literature.</div>

<div class="abstract">Electron correlation and topology are two central threads of modern condensed matter physics. Semiconductor moir\'e materials provide a highly tunable platform for studies of electron correlation. Correlation-driven phenomena, including the Mott insulator, generalized Wigner crystals, stripe phases and continuous Mott transition, have been demonstrated. However, nontrivial band topology has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e heterobilayers. Unlike in the AA-stacked structures, an out-of-plane electric field controls not only the bandwidth but also the band topology by intertwining moir\'e bands centered at different high-symmetry stacking sites. At half band filling, corresponding to one particle per moir\'e unit cell, we observe quantized Hall resistance, h/e2 (with h and e denoting the Planck's constant and electron charge, respectively), and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. The electric-field-induced topological phase transition from a Mott insulator to a QAH insulator precedes an insulator-to-metal transition; contrary to most known topological phase transitions, it is not accompanied by a bulk charge gap closure. Our study paves the path for discovery of a wealth of emergent phenomena arising from the combined influence of strong correlation and topology in semiconductor moir\'e materials.</div>

<div class="abstract">The recent observation of high-lying Rydberg states of excitons in semiconductors with relatively high binding energy motivates exploring their applications in quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information processing. Here, we study Rydberg excitation dynamics of a mesoscopic array of excitons to demonstrate its application in simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. We show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered phase can be reached using physical parameters available for cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) by optimizing driving laser parameters such as duration, intensity, and frequency. In an example, we study the application of our proposed system to solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem based on the Rydberg blockade effect.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We propose a tunable coupler consisting of N off-resonant and fixed-frequency qubits that can tune and even amplify the effective interaction between two general circuit components. The tuning range of the interaction is proportional to N, with a minimum value of zero and a maximum that can exceed the physical coupling rates in the system. The effective coupling rate is determined by the collective magnetic quantum number of the qubit ensemble, which takes only discrete values and is free from collective decay and decoherence. Using single-photon pi-pulses, the coupling rate can be switched between arbitrary initial and final values within the dynamic range in a single step without going through intermediate values. A cascade of the couplers for amplifying small interactions or weak signals is also discussed. These results should not only stimulate interest in exploring the collective effects in quantum information processing, but also enable development of applications in tuning and amplifying the interactions in a general cavity-QED system.</div>

<div class="abstract">Rapid miniaturization of electronic devices and circuits demands profound understanding of fluctuation phenomena at the nanoscale. Superconducting nanowires -- serving as important building blocks for such devices -- may seriously suffer from fluctuations which tend to destroy long-range order and suppress superconductivity. In particular, quantum phase slips (QPS) proliferating at low temperatures may turn a quasi-one-dimensional superconductor into a resistor or an insulator. Here, we introduce a physical concept of QPS-controlled localization of Cooper pairs that may occur even in uniform nanowires without any dielectric barriers being a fundamental manifestation of the flux-charge duality in superconductors. We demonstrate -- both experimentally and theoretically -- that deep in the "insulating" state such nanowires actually exhibit non-trivial superposition of superconductivity and weak Coulomb blockade of Cooper pairs generated by quantum tunneling of magnetic fluxons across the wire.</div>

We examine accuracy of the new algorithm for the random antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional, triangular, and square lattices. We then find that the entanglement-based tSDRG achieves better accuracy than the previous one for the square lattice model with weak randomness, while it is less efficient for the one-dimensional and triangular lattice models particularly in the strong randomness region.

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>N. Roy, A. Sharma</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We investigate the nonequilbrium dynamics of entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of noninteracting fermions at half-filling starting from a product state to distinguish the delocalized, multifractal (in the limit of nearest neighbor hopping), localized and mixed phases hosted by the quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model in the presence of long-range hopping. For sufficiently long-range hopping strength a secondary logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy is found in the mixed phases whereas the primary behavior is a power-law the exponent of which is different in different phases. The saturation value of entanglement entropy in the delocalized, multifractal and mixed phases depends linearly on system size whereas in the localized phase (in the short-range regime) it is independent of system size. The early-time growth of OTOC shows very different power-law behaviors in the presence of nearest neighbor hopping and long-range hopping. The late time decay of OTOC leads to noticeably different power-law exponents in different phases. The spatial profile of OTOC and its system-size dependence also provide distinct features to distinguish phases. In the mixed phases the spatial profile of OTOC shows two different dependences on space for small and large distances respectively. Interestingly the spatial profile contains large fluctuations at the special locations related to the quasiperiodicity parameter in the presence of multifractal states.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>H. Xu, J. Zhou, J. Li</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect generates quantized electric charge Hall conductance without external magnetic field. It requires both nontrivial band topology and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. In most cases, one could break the TRS of time-reversal invariant topological materials to yield QAH effect, which is essentially a topological phase transition. Conventional topological phase transition induced by external field/stimulus needs a route along which the bandgap closes and re-opens. Hence, the phase transition occurs only when the magnitude of field/stimulus is larger than a critical value. In this work we propose that using gapless surface states, the transition can happen at arbitrarily weak (but finite) external field strength. This can be regarded as an unconventional topological phase transition, where the bandgap closing is guaranteed by bulk-edge correspondence and symmetries, while the bandgap reopening is induced by external fields. We demonstrate this concept on the 2D surface states of 3D topological insulators like $\rm Bi_2Se_3$, which become 2D QAH insulators once a circularly polarized light is turned on, according to van Vleck's effective Hamiltonian in Floquet time crystal theory. The sign of quantized Chern number can be controlled via the chirality of the light. This provides a convenient and dynamical approach to trigger topological phase transitions and create QAH insulators.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We characterize the variational power of quantum circuit tensor networks in the representation of physical many-body ground-states. Such tensor networks are formed by replacing the dense block unitaries and isometries in standard tensor networks by local quantum circuits. We explore both quantum circuit matrix product states and the quantum circuit multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz, and introduce an adaptive method to optimize the resulting circuits to high fidelity with more than $10^4$ parameters. We benchmark their expressiveness against standard tensor networks, as well as other common circuit architectures, for both the energy and correlation functions of the 1D Heisenberg and Fermi-Hubbard models in the gapless regime. We find quantum circuit tensor networks to be substantially more expressive than other quantum circuits for these problems, and that they can even be more compact than standard tensor networks. Extrapolating to circuit depths which can no longer be emulated classically, this suggests a region of quantum advantage with respect to expressiveness in the representation of physical ground-states.</div>

<div class="abstract">Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is a class of promising techniques capable of reducing the computational error of variational quantum algorithms tailored for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. The recently proposed permutation-based methods are practically attractive, since they do not rely on any a priori information concerning the quantum channels. In this treatise, we propose a general framework termed as permutation filters, which includes the existing permutation-based methods as special cases. In particular, we show that the proposed filter design algorithm always converge to the global optimum, and that the optimal filters can provide substantial improvements over the existing permutation-based methods in the presence of narrowband quantum noise, corresponding to large-depth, high-error-rate quantum circuits.</div>

<div class="abstract">Recently, the European Commission supported by many European countries has announced large investments towards the commercialization of quantum technology (QT) to address and mitigate some of the biggest challenges facing today's digital era - e.g. secure communication and computing power. For more than two decades the QT community has been working on the development of QTs, which promise landmark breakthroughs leading to commercialization in various areas. The ambitious goals of the QT community and expectations of EU authorities cannot be met solely by individual initiatives of single countries, and therefore, require a combined European effort of large and unprecedented dimensions comparable only to the Galileo or Copernicus programs. Strong international competition calls for a coordinated European effort towards the development of QT in and for space, including research and development of technology in the areas of communication and sensing. Here, we aim at summarizing the state of the art in the development of quantum technologies which have an impact in the field of space applications. Our goal is to outline a complete framework for the design, development, implementation, and exploitation of quantum technology in space.</div>

The nontrivial band topology originates from a unique combination of angular twist and local mirror symmetry breaking in each individual layer, which results in unusual skyrmionic spin textures in momentum space with skyrmion number $\mathcal{S} = \pm 2$. Our Hartree-Fock analysis further suggests that density-density interactions generically drive the system at $1/2$-filling into a valley-polarized state, which realizes a correlated quantum anomalous Hall state with Chern number $\mathcal{C} = \pm 2$.

All qubits have individual control and readout lines. Their frequency tunability allows to change the number N of resonantly coupled qubits and also to introduce a disorder in their excitation frequencies with preassigned distributions. While increasing N, we demonstrate the expected $N^{1/2}$ scaling law for the energy gap (Rabi splitting) between bright modes around the cavity frequency. By introducing a controllable disorder and averaging the transmission amplitude over a large number of realizations, we demonstrate a decay of mesoscopic fluctuations which mimics an approach towards the thermodynamic limit. The collective bright states survive in the presence of disorder when the strength of individual qubit coupling to the cavity dominates over the disorder strength.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Analog quantum algorithms are formulated in terms of Hamiltonians rather than unitary gates and include quantum adiabatic computing, quantum annealing, and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are promising candidates for near-term quantum applications, but they often require fine tuning via the annealing schedule or variational parameters. In this work, we explore connections between these analog algorithms, as well as limits in which they become approximations of the optimal procedure.Notably, we explore how the optimal procedure approaches a smooth adiabatic procedure but with a superposed oscillatory pattern that can be explained in terms of the interactions between the ground state and first excited state that effect the coherent error cancellation of diabatic transitions. Furthermore, we provide numeric and analytic evidence that QAOA emulates this optimal procedure with the length of each QAOA layer equal to the period of the oscillatory pattern. Additionally, the ratios of the QAOA bangs are determined by the smooth, non-oscillatory part of the optimal procedure. We provide arguments for these phenomena in terms of the product formula expansion of the optimal procedure. With these arguments, we conclude that different analog algorithms can emulate the optimal protocol under different limits and approximations. Finally, we present a new algorithm for better approximating the optimal protocol using the analytic and numeric insights from the rest of the paper. In practice, numerically, we find that this algorithm outperforms standard QAOA and naive quantum annealing procedures.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Impressive progress has been made in the past decade in the study of technological applications of varied types of quantum systems. With industry giants like IBM laying down their roadmap for scalable quantum devices with more than 1000-qubits by the end of 2023, efficient validation techniques are also being developed for testing quantum processing on these devices. The characterization of a quantum state is done by experimental measurements through the process called quantum state tomography (QST) which scales exponentially with the size of the system. However, QST performed using incomplete measurements is aptly suited for characterizing these quantum technologies especially with the current nature of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices where not all mean measurements are available with high fidelity. We, hereby, propose an alternative approach to QST for the complete reconstruction of the density matrix of a quantum system in a pure state for any number of qubits by applying the maximal entropy formalism on the pairwise combinations of the known mean measurements. This approach provides the best estimate of the target state when we know the complete set of observables which is the case of convergence of the reconstructed density matrix to a pure state. Our goal is to provide a practical inference of a quantum system in a pure state that can find its applications in the field of quantum error mitigation on a real quantum computer that we intend to investigate further.</div>

Here we will consider the dynamical effects on the DOS and transmission when the magnetic impurities are driven periodically. Using the Floquet formalism and Green's functions, the system properties are studied as a function of the driving frequency and the potential energy contribution of the impurities. We see that increasing the potential part closes the DOS gap for all driving regimes. The transmission gap is also closed, showing an pronounced asymmetry as a function of energy. These features indicate that the dynamical transport properties could yield valuable information about the magnetic impurities.</div>

<div class="abstract">Silicon is a leading qubit platform thanks to the exceptional coherence times that can be achieved and to the available commercial manufacturing platform for integration. Building scalable quantum processing architectures relies on accurate quantum state manipulation, which can only be achieved through a complete understanding of the underlying quantum state properties. This article reviews the electrical methods that have been developed to probe the quantum states encoded in individual and interacting atom qubits in silicon, from the pioneering single electron tunneling spectroscopy framework in nanoscale transistors, to radio frequency reflectometry to probe coherence properties and scanning tunneling microscopy to directly image the wave function at the atomic scale. Together with the development of atomistic simulations of realistic devices, these methods are today applied to other emerging dopant and optically addressable defect states to accelerate the engineering of quantum technologies in silicon.</div>

<div class="abstract">Constrained by the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, in all so-far experimentally determined Weyl semimetals (WSMs) the Weyl points (WPs) always appear in pairs in the momentum space with no exception. As a consequence, Fermi arcs occur on surfaces which connect the projections of the WPs with opposite chiral charges. However, this situation can be circumvented in the case of unpaired WP, without relevant surface Fermi arc connecting its surface projection, appearing singularly, while its Berry curvature field is absorbed by nontrivial charged nodal walls. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we show experimentally that a singular Weyl point emerges in PtGa at the center of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which is surrounded by closed Weyl nodal walls located at the BZ boundaries and there is no Fermi arc connecting its surface projection. Our results reveal that nontrivial band crossings of different dimensionalities can emerge concomitantly in condensed matter, while their coexistence ensures the net topological charge of different dimensional topological objects to be zero. Our observation extends the applicable range of the original Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem which was derived from zero dimensional paired WPs with opposite chirality.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>B. Tariq, X. Hu</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The presence of degenerate conduction band valleys and how they are mixed by interfaces play critical roles in determining electron interaction and spectrum in a silicon nanostructure. Here we investigate how the valley phases affect the exchange interaction in a symmetric two-electron silicon double quantum dot. Through a configuration interaction calculation, we find that exchange splitting is suppressed at a finite value of valley phase difference between the two dots, and reaches its minimum value ({\sim} 0) when the phase difference is {\pi}. Such a suppression can be explained using the Hubbard model, through the valley-phase-dependent dressing by the doubly occupied states on the ground singlet and triplet states. The contributions of the higher orbital states also play a vital role in determining the value of the exchange energy in general, which is a crucial parameter for applications such as exchange gates for spin qubits.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">High-fidelity control of quantum bits is paramount for the reliable execution of quantum algorithms and for achieving fault-tolerance, the ability to correct errors faster than they occur. The central requirement for fault-tolerance is expressed in terms of an error threshold. Whereas the actual threshold depends on many details, a common target is the ~1% error threshold of the well-known surface code. Reaching two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% has been a long-standing major goal for semiconductor spin qubits. These qubits are well positioned for scaling as they can leverage advanced semiconductor technology. Here we report a spin-based quantum processor in silicon with single- and two-qubit gate fidelities all above 99.5%, extracted from gate set tomography. The average single-qubit gate fidelities remain above 99% when including crosstalk and idling errors on the neighboring qubit. Utilizing this high-fidelity gate set, we execute the demanding task of calculating molecular ground state energies using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. Now that the 99% barrier for the two-qubit gate fidelity has been surpassed, semiconductor qubits have gained credibility as a leading platform, not only for scaling but also for high-fidelity control.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>J. Cano, L. Elcoro, M. I. Aroyo, B. A. Bernevig, B. Bradlyn</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We consider the extent to which symmetry eigenvalues reveal the topological character of bands. Specifically, we compare distinct atomic limit phases (band representations) that share the same irreducible representations (irreps) at all points in the Brillouin zone and, therefore, appear equivalent in a classification based on eigenvalues. We derive examples where such "irrep-equivalent" phases can be distinguished by a quantized Berry phase or generalization thereof. These examples constitute a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain: neither phase is topological, in the sense that localized Wannier functions exist, yet there is a topological obstruction between them. We refer to two phases as "Berry obstructed atomic limits" if they have the same irreps, but differ by Berry phases. This is a distinct notion from eigenvalue obstructed atomic limits, which differ in their symmetry irreps at some point in the Brillouin zone. We compute exhaustive lists of elementary band representations that are irrep-equivalent, in all space groups, with and without time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, and use group theory to derive a set of necessary conditions for irrep-equivalence. Finally, we conjecture, and in some cases prove, that irrep-equivalent elementary band representations that are not equivalent can be distinguished by a topological invariant.</div>

<div class="abstract">The discrete time crystal (DTC) is a recently discovered phase of matter that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. Disorder-induced many-body-localization is required to stabilize a DTC to arbitrary times, yet an experimental investigation of this localized regime has proven elusive. Here, we observe the hallmark signatures of a many-body-localized DTC using a novel quantum simulation platform based on individually controllable $^{13}$C nuclear spins in diamond. We demonstrate the characteristic long-lived spatiotemporal order and confirm that it is robust for generic initial states. Our results are consistent with the realization of an out-of-equilibrium Floquet phase of matter and establish a programmable quantum simulator based on solid-state spins for exploring many-body physics.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>S. H. Simon</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Certain fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions -- particularly including the Laughlin, Moore-Read, and Read-Rezayi wavefunctions -- have special structure that makes them amenable to analysis using an exeptionally wide range of techniques including conformal field theory (CFT), thin cylinder or torus limit, study of symmetric polynomials and Jack polynomials, and so-called ``special" parent Hamiltonians. This review discusses these techniques as well as explaining to what degree some other quantum Hall wavefunctions share this special structure. Along the way we will explore the physics of quantum Hall edges, entanglement spectra, quasiparticles, nonabelian braiding statistics, and Hall viscosity, among other topics. As compared to a number of other recent reviews, most of this review is written so as to {\it not} rely on results from conformal field theory -- although a short discussion of a few key relations to CFT are included near the end.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>J. R. M. d. Nova, F. Sols</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We propose the concept of a spontaneous many-body Floquet state. This is a state that, in the absence of external periodic driving, still self-oscillates like in the presence of a Floquet Hamiltonian, this behavior being spontaneously induced by many-body interactions. Furthermore, we prove that it is also a time crystal, presenting long-range time-periodic order. However, its time crystalline behavior is very different to that of conventional Floquet discrete time crystals: here, there is no external periodic driving, and the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is continuous instead of discrete. We also demonstrate that a spontaneous many-body Floquet state can be implemented in a one-dimensional flowing atom condensate, resulting from a dynamical phase transition and stable against quantum fluctuations, and propose realistic experimental scenarios for its observation. The realization of a spontaneous many-body Floquet state would then not only provide a novel form of ordered quantum matter, but also a continuous time crystal.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We propose a static auxiliary field approximation to study the hybridization physics of Kondo systems without the sign problem and use the mutual information to measure the intersite hybridization correlations. Our method takes full account of the spatial fluctuations of the hybridization fields at all orders and overcomes the artificial (first-order) phase transition predicted in the mean-field approximation. When applied to the two-impurity Kondo model, it reveals a logarithmically divergent amplitude mutual information near the so-called "Varma-Jones" fixed point and a large phase mutual information manifesting the development of intersite phase coherence in the Kondo regime, with observable influences on physical properties. These highlight the importance of hybridization fluctuations and confirm the mutual information as a useful tool to explore the hybridization physics in Kondo systems.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>J. Wurtz, D. Lykov</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a near-term combinatorial optimization algorithm suitable for noisy quantum devices. However, little is known about performance guarantees for $p>2$. A recent work computing MaxCut performance guarantees for 3-regular graphs conjectures that any $d$-regular graph evaluated at particular fixed angles has an approximation ratio greater than some worst-case guarantee. In this work, we provide numerical evidence for this fixed angle conjecture for $p<12$. We compute and provide these angles via numerical optimization and tensor networks. These fixed angles serve for an optimization-free version of QAOA, and have universally good performance on any 3 regular graph. Heuristic evidence is presented for the fixed angle conjecture on graph ensembles, which suggests that these fixed angles are ``close" to global optimum. Under the fixed angle conjecture, QAOA has a larger performance guarantee than the Goemans Williamson algorithm on 3-regular graphs for $p\geq 11$, and is projected to beat special purpose classical algorithms for $p\sim 30$.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>W. Li, S. Ran</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, the very first step is to embed the data in quantum space known as Hilbert space. Developing quantum kernel function (QKF), which defines the distances among the samples in the Hilbert space, belongs to the fundamental topics for machine learning. In this work, we propose the rescaled logarithmic fidelity (RLF) and a non-parametric active learning in the quantum space, which we name as RLF-NAL. The rescaling takes advantage of the non-linearity of the kernel to tune the mutual distances of samples in the Hilbert space, and meanwhile avoids the exponentially-small fidelities between quantum many-qubit states. We compare RLF-NAL with several well-known non-parametric algorithms including naive Bayes classifiers, $k$-nearest neighbors, and spectral clustering. Our method exhibits excellent accuracy particularly for the unsupervised case with no labeled samples and the few-shot cases with small numbers of labeled samples. With the visualizations by t-SNE, our results imply that the machine learning in the Hilbert space complies with the principles of maximal coding rate reduction, where the low-dimensional data exhibit within-class compressibility, between-class discrimination, and overall diversity. Our proposals can be applied to other quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, including the methods using the parametric models such as tensor networks, quantum circuits, and quantum neural networks.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Bayesian estimation approaches, which are capable of combining the information of experimental data from different likelihood functions to achieve high precisions, have been widely used in phase estimation via introducing a controllable auxiliary phase. Here, we present a non-adaptive Bayesian phase estimation (BPE) algorithms with an ingenious update rule of the auxiliary phase designed via active learning. Unlike adaptive BPE algorithms, the auxiliary phase in our algorithm is determined by a pre-established update rule with simple statistical analysis of a small batch of data, instead of complex calculations in every update trails. As the number of measurements for a same amount of Bayesian updates is significantly reduced via active learning, our algorithm can work as efficient as adaptive ones and shares the advantages (such as wide dynamic range and perfect noise robustness) of non-adaptive ones. Our algorithm is of promising applications in various practical quantum sensors such as atomic clocks and quantum magnetometers.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In recent years nonlocality has been extensively explored as a resource for self-testing -- a device-independent way of certification of entangled quantum states and measurements performed on them. However, most of the efforts in designing self-testing schemes were concerned with entangled quantum states, leaving the problem of certification of quantum measurements largely unexplored. Here we address this problem, concentrating on a simpler, one-sided device-independent scenario. We propose a simple scheme for certification of any set of d-outcome projective measurements which do not share any common invariant subspace, termed here genuinely incompatible, and the maximally entangled state of two qudits. We also study robustness of our self-testing statements for a certain class of genuinely incompatible measurements including mutually unbiased bases.</div>
