<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We introduce a two-dimensional electronic insulator that possesses a toric code topological order enriched by translation symmetry. This state can be realized from disordering a weak topological superconductor by double-vortex condensation. It is termed the toric code insulator, whose anyonic excitations consist of a charge-$e$ chargon, a neutral fermion and two types of visons. There are two types of visons because they have constrained motion as a consequence of the fractional Josephson effect of one-dimensional topological superconductor. Importantly, these two types of visons are related by a discrete translation symmetry and have a mutual semionic braiding statistics, leading to a symmetry-enrichment akin to the type in Wen's plaquette model and Kitaev's honeycomb model. We construct this state using a three-fluid coupled-wire model, and analyze the anyon spectrum and braiding statistics in detail to unveil the nature of symmetry-enrichment due to translation. We also discuss potential material realizations and present a band-theoretic understanding of the state, fitting it into a general framework for studying fractionalizaton in strongly-interacting weak topological phases.</div>

<div class="title"><b>Title:</b> Dynamical second-order noise sweetspots in resonantly driven spin qubits</div>
<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>J. Pico-Cortes, G. Platero</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum dot-based quantum computation employs extensively the exchange interaction between nearby electronic spins in order to manipulate and couple different qubits. The exchange interaction, however, couples the qubit states to charge noise, which reduces the fidelity of the quantum gates that employ it. The effect of charge noise can be mitigated by working at noise sweetspots in which the sensitivity to charge variations is reduced. In this work we study the response to charge noise of a double quantum dot based qubit in the presence of ac gates, with arbitrary driving amplitudes, applied either to the dot levels or to the tunneling barrier. Tuning with an ac driving allows to manipulate the sign and strength of the exchange interaction as well as its coupling to environmental electric noise. Moreover, we show the possibility of inducing a second-order sweetspot in the resonant spin-triplet qubit in which the dephasing time is significantly increased.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>J. Osca, B. Soree</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We investigate the torque field and skyrmion movement at an interface between a ferromagnet hosting a skyrmion and a material with strong spin-orbit interaction. We analyze both semiconductor materials and topological insulators using a Hamiltonian model that includes a linear term. The spin torque inducing current is considered to flow in the single band limit therefore a quantum model of current is used. Skyrmion movement due spin transfer torque proves to be more difficult in presence of spin orbit interaction in the case where only interface in-plane currents are present. However, edge effects in narrow nanowires can be used to drive the skyrmion movement and to exert a limited control on its movement direction. We also show the differences and similarities between torque fields due to electric current in the many and in the single band limits.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The discovery of an ever increasing family of atomic layered magnetic materials, together with the already established vast catalogue of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and topological systems, calls for some guiding principles to tailor and optimize novel spin transport and optical properties at their interfaces. Here we focus on the latest developments in both fields that have brought them closer together and make them ripe for future fruitful synergy. After outlining fundamentals on van der Waals (vdW) magnetism and SOC effects, we discuss how their coexistence, manipulation and competition could ultimately establish new ways to engineer robust spin textures and drive the generation and dynamics of spin current and magnetization switching in 2D materials-based vdW heterostructures. Grounding our analysis on existing experimental results and theoretical considerations, we draw a prospective analysis about how intertwined magnetism and spin-orbit torque (SOT) phenomena combine at interfaces with well-defined symmetries, and how this dictates the nature and figures-of-merit of SOT and angular momentum transfer. This will serve as a guiding role in designing future non-volatile memory devices that utilize the unique properties of 2D materials with the spin degree of freedom.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are platforms for realizing effective $p$-wave superconductivity. Spin-orbit coupling, combined with the proximity effect, causes the two-dimensional semiconductor to inherit $p \pm i p$ intraband pairing, and application of magnetic field can then result in transitions to the normal state, partial Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, or topological phases with Majorana modes. Experimentally probing the hybrid superconductor-semiconductor interface is challenging due to the shunting effect of the conventional superconductor. Consequently, the nature of induced pairing remains an open question. Here, we use the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture to probe induced superconductivity in a two dimensional Al-InAs hybrid system. We observe a strong suppression of superfluid density and enhanced dissipation driven by magnetic field, which cannot be accounted for by the depairing theory of an $s$-wave superconductor. These observations are explained by a picture of independent intraband $p \pm i p$ superconductors giving way to partial Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and allow for the first characterization of key properties of the hybrid superconducting system.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Metamaterial photonic integrated circuits with arrays of hybrid graphene-superconductor coupled split-ring resonators (SRR) capable of modulating and slowing down terahertz (THz) light are introduced and proposed. The hybrid device optical responses, such as electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) and group delay, can be modulated in several ways. First, it is modulated electrically by changing the conductivity and carrier concentrations in graphene. Alternatively, the optical response can be modified by acting on the device temperature sensitivity, by switching Nb from a lossy normal phase to a low-loss quantum mechanical phase below the transition temperature (Tc) of Nb. Maximum modulation depths of 57.3 % and 97.61 % are achieved for EIT and group delay at the THz transmission window, respectively. A comparison is carried out between the Nb-graphene-Nb coupled SRR-based devices with those of Au-graphene-Au SRRs and a significant enhancement of the THz transmission, group delay, and EIT responses are observed when Nb is in the quantum mechanical phase. Such hybrid devices with their reasonably large and tunable slow light bandwidth pave the way for the realization of active optoelectronic modulators, filters, phase shifters, and slow light devices for applications in chip-scale quantum communication and quantum processing.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>M. Hu, H. Liu, S. Zhu</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The past decade has witnessed a booming development of topological photonics, which revolutionizes the methodology for controlling the behavior of light. A gigantic achievement is to engineer robust confined modes localized at interfaces between topologically distinct regions, where the optical context can trigger exotic topological phenomena exclusive to photons. Here, we provide an experimentally flexible approach to engineering topologically induced interface states in the visible regime via a unique design of complex superlattice formed by connecting two component superlattices of distinguished topological phases. Assisted by the intrinsic pseudospin degree due to the splitting between TM and TE polarized modes, we attain a precise manipulation of the spin-dependent topological interface states that can manifest themselves straightforwardly through transmission spectra. More specifically, since these topological localized modes stem from the hybridization of artificial photonic orbitals that are of topological origin as well, they are deemed as a novel topological effect and thus named as the secondary topological interface states. Our work develops an innovative and productive strategy to tune topologically protected localized modes, based on which various applications such as selective local enhancement can be exploited.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In a topological insulator (TI)/magnetic insulator (MI) hetero-structure, large spin-orbit coupling of the TI and inversion symmetry breaking at the interface could foster non-planar spin textures such as skyrmions at the interface. This is observed as topological Hall effect in a conventional Hall set-up. While this effect has been observed at the interface of TI/MI, where MI beholds perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, non-trivial spin-textures that develop in interfacial MI with in-plane magnetic anisotropy is under-reported. In this work, we study Bi$_2$Te$_3$/EuS hetero-structure using planar Hall effect (PHE). We observe planar topological Hall and spontaneous planar Hall features that are characteristic of non-trivial in-plane spin textures at the interface. We find that the latter is minimum when the current and magnetic field directions are aligned parallel, and maximum when they are aligned perpendicularly within the sample plane, which maybe attributed to the underlying planar anisotropy of the spin-texture. These results demonstrate the importance of PHE for sensitive detection and characterization of non-trivial magnetic phase that has evaded exploration in the TI/MI interface.</div>

<div class="abstract">Topological edge states exhibit dissipationless transport and electrically-driven topological phase transitions, making them ideal for next-generation transistors that are not constrained by Moore's law. Nevertheless, their dispersion has never been probed and is often assumed to be simply linear, without any rigorous justification. Here we determine the non-linear electrical response of topological edge states in the ballistic regime and demonstrate the way this response ascertains the presence of symmetry breaking terms in the edge dispersion, such as deviations from non-linearity and tilted spin quantization axes. The non-linear response stems from discontinuities in the band occupation on either side of a Zeeman gap, and its direction is set by the spin orientation with respect to the Zeeman field. We determine the edge dispersion for several classes of topological materials and discuss experimental measurement.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>T. Funato, M. Matsuo</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We theoretically study the mechanical induction of the spin density via the Rashba spin--orbit interaction (SOI). The spin density in the linear response to lattice distortion dynamics is calculated based on the microscopic theory. We reveal that there are two mechanisms of spin induction: one is the acoustic Edelstein effect (AEE) from the acceleration of the lattice dynamics and the other is caused by the Rashba spin--vorticity coupling (RSVC). We find that the AEE induces a more efficient spin-to-charge conversion in comparison with the conventional electric Edelstein effect. The induced spin density due to the RSVC is expressed as a Berry curvature-like quantity; therefore, it can be attributed to the spatial symmetry breaking due to the Rashba SOI. Our work demonstrates high-efficiency spin generation in Rashba systems.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The Hall effect, in which current flows perpendicular to an applied electrical bias, has played a prominent role in modern condensed matter physics over much of the subject's history. Appearing variously in classical, relativistic and quantum guises, it has among other roles contributed to establishing the band theory of solids, to research on new phases of strongly interacting electrons, and to the phenomenology of topological condensed matter. The dissipationless Hall current requires time-reversal symmetry breaking. For over a century it has either been ascribed to externally applied magnetic field and referred to as the ordinary Hall effect, or ascribed to spontaneous non-zero total internal magnetization (ferromagnetism) and referred to as the anomalous Hall effect. It has not commonly been associated with antiferromagnetic order. More recently, however, theoretical predictions and experimental observations have identified large Hall effects in some compensated magnetic crystals, governed by neither of the global magnetic-dipole symmetry breaking mechanisms mentioned above. The goals of this article are to systematically organize the present understanding of anomalous antiferromagnetic materials that generate a non-zero Hall effect, which we will call anomalous Hall antiferromagnets, and to discuss this class of materials in a broader fundamental and applied research context. Our motivation in drawing attention to anomalous Hall antiferromagnets is two-fold. First, since Hall effects that are not governed by magnetic dipole symmetry breaking are at odds with the traditional understanding of the phenomenon, the topic deserves attention on its own. Second, this new reincarnation has again placed the Hall effect in the middle of an emerging field of physics at the intersection of multipole magnetism, topological condensed matter, and spintronics.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We study theoretically the effect of a rotating electric field on a diffusive nanowire and find an effect that is analogous to spin pumping, which refers to the generation of spin through a rotating magnetic field. The electron spin couples to an external electric field because the particle motion induces an effective magnetic field in its rest frame. In a diffusive system the velocity of the particle, and therefore also its effecive magnetic field, rapidly and randomly changes direction. Nevertheless, we demonstrate analytically and via a physical argument why the combination of the two effects described above produces a finite magnetization along the axis of rotation. This manifests as a measurable spin-voltage in the range of tens of microvolts.</div>

Although the classification proves their existence, it does not indicate a way of calculating the values of those invariants. Here, we show that a specific set of concentric Wilson loops and line invariants yields the values of all topological invariants in two-dimensional systems with pure rotation symmetry in class AII. Examples of this analysis are given for specific models with two-fold and three-fold rotational symmetry.

<div class="abstract">We study a new diluted magnetic semiconductor system based on the spin of the ionized acceptor Cr$^+$. We show that the negatively charged Cr$^+$ ion, an excited state of the Cr in II-VI semiconductor, can be stable when inserted in a CdTe quantum dot (QD). The Cr$^+$ attracts a heavy-hole in the QD and form a stable hole-Cr$^+$ complex. Optical probing of this system reveals a ferromagnetic coupling between heavy-holes and Cr$^+$ spins. At low temperature, the thermalization on the ground state of the hole-Cr$^+$ system with parallel spins prevents the optical recombination of the excess electron on the 3$d$ shell of the atom. We study the dynamics of the nano-magnet formed by the hole-Cr$^+$ exchange interaction. The ferromagnetic ground states with M$_z$=$\pm$4 can be controlled by resonant optical pumping and a spin relaxation time in the 20 $\mu$s range is obtained at T=4.2 K.

The observation of two nearly dispersionless SdH frequency branches provides unambiguous evidence of four Fermi surface sheets at the R point that reflect the symmetry-enforced orthogonality of the underlying wave functions at the intersections with the NPs.

<div class="abstract">In the presence of certain symmetries, three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can harbor not only surface Fermi arcs, but also surface Dirac cones. Motivated by the experimental observation of rotation-symmetry-protected Dirac semimetal states in iron-based superconductors, we investigate the potential intrinsic topological phases in a $C_{4z}$-rotational invariant superconducting Dirac semimetal with $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing. When the normal state harbors only surface Fermi arcs on the side surfaces, we find that an interesting gapped superconducting state with a quartet of Majorana cones on each side surface can be realized, even though the first-order topology of its bulk is trivial. When the normal state simultaneously harbors surface Fermi arcs and surface Dirac cones, we find that a second-order time-reversal invariant topological superconductor with helical Majorana hinge states can be realized. The criteria for these two distinct topological phases have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of three characteristic surfaces in momentum space. By reducing the bulk material to a thin film normal to the axis of rotation symmetry, we further find that a two-dimensional first-order time-reversal invariant topological superconductor can be realized if the inversion symmetry is broken by applying a gate voltage. Our work reveals that diverse topological superconducting phases and types of Majorana modes can be realized in superconducting Dirac semimetals.</div>

<div class="authors_head"><b>Authors:</div></b> <div class="authors"><i>P. Prabhu, T. A. Brun</i></div>
<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Classical random walks on finite graphs have an underrated property: a walk from any vertex can reach every other vertex in finite time, provided they are connected. Discrete-time quantum walks on finite connected graphs however, can have infinite hitting times. This phenomenon is related to graph symmetry, as previously characterized by the group of direction-preserving graph automorphisms that trivially affect the coin Hilbert space. If a graph is symmetric enough (in a particular sense) then the associated quantum walk unitary will contain eigenvectors that do not overlap a set of target vertices, for any coin flip operator. These eigenvectors span the Infinite Hitting Time (IHT) subspace. Quantum states in the IHT subspace never reach the target vertices, leading to infinite hitting times. However, this is not the whole story: the graph of the 3D cube does not satisfy this symmetry constraint, yet quantum walks on this graph with certain symmetric coins can exhibit infinite hitting times. We study the effect of coin symmetry by analyzing the group of coin-permutation symmetries (CPS): graph automorphisms that act nontrivially on the coin Hilbert space but leave the coin operator invariant. Unitaries using highly symmetric coins with large CPS groups, such as the permutation-invariant Grover coin, are associated with higher probabilities of never arriving, as a result of their larger IHT subspaces.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Following over a decade of intense efforts to enable major progress in spintronics devices and quantum information technology by means of materials in which the electronic structure exhibits non-trivial topological properties, three key challenges are still unresolved. First, the identification of topological band degeneracies that are generically rather than accidentally located at the Fermi level. Second, the ability to easily control such topological degeneracies. And third, to identify generic topological degeneracies in large, multi-sheeted Fermi surfaces. Combining de Haas - van Alphen spectroscopy with density functional theory and band-topology calculations, we report here that the non-symmorphic symmetries in ferromagnetic MnSi generate nodal planes (NPs), which enforce topological protectorates (TPs) with substantial Berry curvatures at the intersection of the NPs with the Fermi surface (FS) regardless of the complexity of the FS. We predict that these TPs will be accompanied by sizeable Fermi arcs subject to the direction of the magnetization. Deriving the symmetry conditions underlying topological NPs, we show that the 1651 magnetic space groups comprise 7 grey groups and 26 black-and-white groups with topological NPs, including the space group of ferromagnetic MnSi. Thus, the identification of symmetry-enforced TPs on the FS of MnSi that may be controlled with a magnetic field suggests the existence of similar properties, amenable for technological exploitation, in a large number of materials.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Optical lattice clocks can now resolve the height difference below 1 cm by means of the gravitational redshift. Further improvement in the stability enables the clocks to resolve the height difference of subsystems within an atomic ensemble that is conventionally interrogated as a single coherent spin state, resulting in the dephasing of the coherent spin state. This effect is observable with a clock of the stability of $\sim 10^{-21}$ by introducing single layer resolved imaging system for three dimensional optical lattice, and limits the 1 s stability of the clock at $10^{-19}$ without proper compensations. This can be the first observation of the decoherence of a quantum state by a gravitational effect, and the suppression of other systematic shifts to observe this gravitational dephasing seems feasible.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We investigate the interplay of electronic correlations and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for a one-band and a two-band honeycomb lattice model. The main difference between the two models concerning SOC is that in the one-band case the SOC is a purely non-local term in the basis of the $p_z$ orbitals, whereas in the two-band case with $p_x$ and $p_y$ as basis functions it is purely local. In order to grasp the correlation effects on non-local spin-orbit coupling, we apply the TRILEX approach that allows to calculate non-local contributions to the self-energy approximatively. For the two-band case we apply dynamical mean-field theory. In agreement with previous studies, we find that for all parameter values in our study, the effect of correlations on the spin-orbit coupling strength is that the bare effective SOC parameter is increased. However, this increase is much weaker in the non-local than in the local SOC case. Concerning the TRILEX method, we introduce the necessary formulas for calculations with broken SU(2) symmetry.</div>

In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) made of a Kekul\'e lattice of pure dielectrics, where the internal rotation of cylindrical pillars induces optical Dirac degeneracy-breaking. Our calculated dispersion reveals that the synchronized rotation reverses bands and switches parity as well so as to induce topological phase transition. Our simulation demonstrates that such topologically protected edge states can achieve robust transmission in almost arbitrarily-deformed defect waveguides and therefore provides a pragmatically tunable scheme to achieve reconfigurable topological phases.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">In this work, we theoretically study transverse magnetic focusing in a two-dimensional electron gas with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction when proximitized along its edge with a superconducting contact. The presence of superconducting correlations leads to the emergence of chiral Andreev edge states which -- within this weak magnetic field regime -- may be pictured as states following semiclassical skipping orbits with alternating electron-hole nature. The spin-orbit induced splitting of the Fermi surface causes these carriers to move along cyclotron orbits with different radii, allowing for their spatial spin separation. When Andreev reflection takes place at the superconducting lead, scattered carriers flip both their charge and spin, generating distinguishable features in the transport properties of the device. In particular, we report a notable enhancement of the separation between the spin-split focal points, which scales linearly with the number of Andreev scattering events at the anomalous terminal. We support our results by calculating conductance maps to arbitrary points in the sample that provide a complete image of the ballistic electron-hole cyclotron paths.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">The nature of discrete-time quantum walk in the presence of multiple marked states has been studied by Nahimovs and Rivosh. They introduced an exceptional configuration of clustered marked states $i.e.,$ if the marked states are arranged in a $\sqrt{k} \times \sqrt{k}$ cluster within a $\sqrt{N} \times \sqrt{N}$ grid, where $k=n^{2}$ and $n$ an odd integer. They showed that finding a single marked state among the multiple ones using quantum walk with AKR (Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh) coin requires $\Omega(\sqrt{N} - \sqrt{k})$ time. Furthermore, Nahimov and Rivosh also showed that the Grover's coin can find the same configuration of marked state both faster and with higher probability compared to that with the AKR coin. In this article, we show that using lackadaisical quantum walk, a variant of a three-state discrete-time quantum walk on a line, the success probability of finding all the clustered marked states of this exceptional configuration is nearly 1 with smaller run-time. We also show that the weights of the self-loop suggested for multiple marked states in the state-of-the-art works are not optimal for this exceptional configuration of clustered mark states. We propose a range of weights of the self-loop from which only one can give the desired result for this configuration.</div>

<div class="abstract">Electron correlation and topology are two central threads of modern condensed matter physics. Semiconductor moir\'e materials provide a highly tunable platform for studies of electron correlation. Correlation-driven phenomena, including the Mott insulator, generalized Wigner crystals, stripe phases and continuous Mott transition, have been demonstrated. However, nontrivial band topology has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e heterobilayers. Unlike in the AA-stacked structures, an out-of-plane electric field controls not only the bandwidth but also the band topology by intertwining moir\'e bands centered at different high-symmetry stacking sites. At half band filling, corresponding to one particle per moir\'e unit cell, we observe quantized Hall resistance, h/e2 (with h and e denoting the Planck's constant and electron charge, respectively), and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. The electric-field-induced topological phase transition from a Mott insulator to a QAH insulator precedes an insulator-to-metal transition; contrary to most known topological phase transitions, it is not accompanied by a bulk charge gap closure. Our study paves the path for discovery of a wealth of emergent phenomena arising from the combined influence of strong correlation and topology in semiconductor moir\'e materials.</div>

<div class="abstract">The use of the nuclear spins surrounding electron spin qubits as quantum registers and long-lived memories opens the way to new applications in quantum information and biological sensing. Hence, there is a need for generic and robust forms of control of the nuclear registers. Although adiabatic gates are widely used in quantum information, they can become too slow to outpace decoherence. Here, we introduce a technique whereby adiabatic gates arise from the dynamical decoupling protocols that simultaneously extend coherence. We illustrate this pulse-based adiabatic control for nuclear spins around NV centers in diamond. We obtain a closed-form expression from Landau-Zener theory and show that it reliably describes the dynamics. By identifying robust Floquet states, we show that the technique enables polarisation, one-shot flips and state storage for nuclear spins. These results introduce a new control paradigm that combines dynamical decoupling with adiabatic evolution.</div>

We study the magnetic properties of CrSb bilayers on few-layer topological insulator thin films using \emph{ab initio} density functional theory. We find that the intrinsic parts of the total anomalous Hall conductivities of the thin films are non-zero, and approximately quantized. The N\'{e}el temperature of CrSb bilayers on few-layer topological insulator thin films is found to be approximately two times larger than that of an isolated CrSb thin film. Due to the low Fermi level density of states of CrSb, Hall quantization might be achievable by introducing disorder.

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Weyl semimetal is an archetypical gapless topological phase of matter. Its bulk dispersion contains pairs of band degeneracy points, or Weyl points, that act as magnetic monopoles in momentum space and lead to Fermi arc surface states. It also realizes chiral anomaly first discovered in quantum field theory: parallel electric and magnetic fields generate a finite chiral current. Here, we introduce a minimal model for non-Hermitian Weyl semimetal, dubbed point-gap Weyl semimetal, where a pair of Weyl points are located on the imaginary axis of the complex energy plane. We show the generalization triggers a few fundamental changes to the topological characterization and response of Weyl semimetals. The non-Hermitian system is characterized by a new point-gap invariant $W_3$, giving rise to complex Fermi arc surface states that cover the point gap area $W_3$ times. The splitting of Weyl points on the complex energy plane also leads to anisotropic skin effect as well as a novel type of boundary-skin modes in wire geometry. A unique feature of point-gap Weyl semimetal is a time-dependent electric current flowing along the direction of the magnetic field in the absence of electric field, due to the chiral imbalance created by the different lifetime of the Weyl fermions. We discuss the experimental signatures in wave-packet dynamics and possible realizations of point-gap Weyl semimetal in synthetic platforms.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect generates quantized electric charge Hall conductance without external magnetic field. It requires both nontrivial band topology and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. In most cases, one could break the TRS of time-reversal invariant topological materials to yield QAH effect, which is essentially a topological phase transition. Conventional topological phase transition induced by external field/stimulus needs a route along which the bandgap closes and re-opens. Hence, the phase transition occurs only when the magnitude of field/stimulus is larger than a critical value. In this work we propose that using gapless surface states, the transition can happen at arbitrarily weak (but finite) external field strength. This can be regarded as an unconventional topological phase transition, where the bandgap closing is guaranteed by bulk-edge correspondence and symmetries, while the bandgap reopening is induced by external fields. We demonstrate this concept on the 2D surface states of 3D topological insulators like $\rm Bi_2Se_3$, which become 2D QAH insulators once a circularly polarized light is turned on, according to van Vleck's effective Hamiltonian in Floquet time crystal theory. The sign of quantized Chern number can be controlled via the chirality of the light. This provides a convenient and dynamical approach to trigger topological phase transitions and create QAH insulators.</div>

<div class="abstract">Rapid miniaturization of electronic devices and circuits demands profound understanding of fluctuation phenomena at the nanoscale. Superconducting nanowires -- serving as important building blocks for such devices -- may seriously suffer from fluctuations which tend to destroy long-range order and suppress superconductivity. In particular, quantum phase slips (QPS) proliferating at low temperatures may turn a quasi-one-dimensional superconductor into a resistor or an insulator. Here, we introduce a physical concept of QPS-controlled localization of Cooper pairs that may occur even in uniform nanowires without any dielectric barriers being a fundamental manifestation of the flux-charge duality in superconductors. We demonstrate -- both experimentally and theoretically -- that deep in the "insulating" state such nanowires actually exhibit non-trivial superposition of superconductivity and weak Coulomb blockade of Cooper pairs generated by quantum tunneling of magnetic fluxons across the wire.</div>

<div class="title"><b>Title:</b> Moiré flat Chern bands and correlated quantum anomalous Hall states   generated by spin-orbit couplings in twisted homobilayer MoS$_2$</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">We predict that in a twisted homobilayer of transition-metal dichalcogenide MoS$_2$, spin-orbit coupling in the conduction band states from $\pm K$ valleys can give rise to moir\'{e} flat bands with nonzero Chern numbers in each valley. The nontrivial band topology originates from a unique combination of angular twist and local mirror symmetry breaking in each individual layer, which results in unusual skyrmionic spin textures in momentum space with skyrmion number $\mathcal{S} = \pm 2$. Our Hartree-Fock analysis further suggests that density-density interactions generically drive the system at $1/2$-filling into a valley-polarized state, which realizes a correlated quantum anomalous Hall state with Chern number $\mathcal{C} = \pm 2$. Effects of displacement fields are discussed with comparison to nontrivial topology from layer-pseudospin magnetic fields.</div>

<div class="abstract">We explore experimentally a quantum metamaterial based on a superconducting chip with 25 frequency-tunable transmon qubits coupled to a common coplanar resonator. The collective bright and dark modes are probed via the microwave response, i.e., by measuring the transmission amplitude of an external microwave signal. All qubits have individual control and readout lines. Their frequency tunability allows to change the number N of resonantly coupled qubits and also to introduce a disorder in their excitation frequencies with preassigned distributions. While increasing N, we demonstrate the expected $N^{1/2}$ scaling law for the energy gap (Rabi splitting) between bright modes around the cavity frequency. By introducing a controllable disorder and averaging the transmission amplitude over a large number of realizations, we demonstrate a decay of mesoscopic fluctuations which mimics an approach towards the thermodynamic limit. The collective bright states survive in the presence of disorder when the strength of individual qubit coupling to the cavity dominates over the disorder strength.</div>

<div class="abstract">Silicon is a leading qubit platform thanks to the exceptional coherence times that can be achieved and to the available commercial manufacturing platform for integration. Building scalable quantum processing architectures relies on accurate quantum state manipulation, which can only be achieved through a complete understanding of the underlying quantum state properties. This article reviews the electrical methods that have been developed to probe the quantum states encoded in individual and interacting atom qubits in silicon, from the pioneering single electron tunneling spectroscopy framework in nanoscale transistors, to radio frequency reflectometry to probe coherence properties and scanning tunneling microscopy to directly image the wave function at the atomic scale. Together with the development of atomistic simulations of realistic devices, these methods are today applied to other emerging dopant and optically addressable defect states to accelerate the engineering of quantum technologies in silicon.</div>

<div class="abstract">Constrained by the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, in all so-far experimentally determined Weyl semimetals (WSMs) the Weyl points (WPs) always appear in pairs in the momentum space with no exception. As a consequence, Fermi arcs occur on surfaces which connect the projections of the WPs with opposite chiral charges. However, this situation can be circumvented in the case of unpaired WP, without relevant surface Fermi arc connecting its surface projection, appearing singularly, while its Berry curvature field is absorbed by nontrivial charged nodal walls. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we show experimentally that a singular Weyl point emerges in PtGa at the center of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which is surrounded by closed Weyl nodal walls located at the BZ boundaries and there is no Fermi arc connecting its surface projection. Our results reveal that nontrivial band crossings of different dimensionalities can emerge concomitantly in condensed matter, while their coexistence ensures the net topological charge of different dimensional topological objects to be zero. Our observation extends the applicable range of the original Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem which was derived from zero dimensional paired WPs with opposite chirality.</div>

<div class="abstract">Recent experiments have shown the possibility to tune the electron transport properties of metallic nanosized superconductors through a gate voltage. These results renewed the longstanding debate on the interaction between intense electrostatic fields and superconductivity. Indeed, different works suggested competing mechanisms as the cause of the effect: unconventional electric field-effect or quasiparticle injection. By realizing ionic-gated Josephson field-effect nanotransistors (IJoFETs), we provide the conclusive evidence of electrostatic field-driven control of the supercurrent in metallic nanosized superconductors. Our Nb IJoFETs show bipolar giant suppression of the superconducting critical current up to $\sim45\%$ with negligible variation of both the critical temperature and the normal-state resistance, in a setup where both overheating and charge injection are impossible. The microscopic explanation of these results calls upon a novel theory able to describe the non-trivial interaction of static electric fields with conventional superconductivity.</div>

<div class="abstract_head"><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div class="abstract">Helical edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators show a gap in the Density of States (DOS) and suppressed conductance in the presence of ordered magnetic impurities. Here we will consider the dynamical effects on the DOS and transmission when the magnetic impurities are driven periodically. Using the Floquet formalism and Green's functions, the system properties are studied as a function of the driving frequency and the potential energy contribution of the impurities. We see that increasing the potential part closes the DOS gap for all driving regimes. The transmission gap is also closed, showing an pronounced asymmetry as a function of energy. These features indicate that the dynamical transport properties could yield valuable information about the magnetic impurities.</div>

<div class="abstract">Kondo insulators have recently aroused great interest because they are promising materials that host a topological insulator state caused by the strong electron interactions. Moreover, recent observations of the quantum oscillations in the insulating state of Kondo insulators have come as a great surprise. Here, to investigate the surface electronic state of a prototype Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$, we measured transport properties of single crystals and microstructures. In all samples, the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is insulating at high temperatures and the resistivity exhibits a plateau at low temperatures. The magnitude of the plateau value decreases with reducing sample thickness, which is quantitatively consistent with the surface electronic conduction in the bulk insulating YbB$_{12}$. Moreover, the magnetoresistance of the microstructures exhibits a weak-antilocalization effect at low field. These results are consistent with the presence of topologically protected surface state, suggesting that YbB$_{12}$ is a candidate material of the topological Kondo insulator. The high field resistivity measurements up to $\mu_0H$ = 50 T of the microstructures provide supporting evidence that the quantum oscillations of the resistivity in YbB$_{12}$ occurs in the insulating bulk.</div>
